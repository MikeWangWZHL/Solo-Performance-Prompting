Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in house 3.\n2. Since the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk (Clue 5), the person who only drinks water must live in house 4 or 5. If the person who only drinks water lives in house 4, then the person who is eating kiwis would live in house 2 (Clue 7). However, this would mean that the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 4 (Clue 18), which is a contradiction. Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in house 5, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 3 (Clue 7).\n3. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 3 (Clue 4), and the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 4 (Clue 15).

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 2, and the coffee drinker lives in house 1.\n4. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker (Clue 14). Since the person who has a vase of tulips cannot live in house 1, the tea drinker must live in house 1, and the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 2.\n5. The person who is eating grapes cannot live in house 1 because the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes (Clue 17). Therefore, the person who is eating grapes lives in house 3, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.\n6. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis (Clue 18). Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 3, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in house 1.\n7. The person who has a carnations arrangement and the cricketer live directly next to each other (Clue 10). Since the person who has a carnations arrangement cannot live in house 1, the cricketer must live in house 1, and the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 2.\n8. The swimmer lives directly left of the golfer (Clue 16). Since the swimmer cannot live in house 1, the golfer must live in house 3, and the swimmer lives in house 2.\n9. The baseball player lives in house 4 (Clue 11).\n10. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house (Clue 2). Since the person who is eating oranges cannot live in house 1, 3, or 4, the person who is eating oranges must live in house 5.\n11. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first or third house (Clue 3 and Clue 13). Therefore, the person who is eating mangos must live in house 4.\n12. The person who is wearing boots lives in house 5 because there is one house between where the person who is wearing boots lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives (Clue 6).\n13. The person who is wearing high heels must live in house 1 because all other shoe types have been assigned to other houses.\n14. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 5 because the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet (Clue 9).\n15.
