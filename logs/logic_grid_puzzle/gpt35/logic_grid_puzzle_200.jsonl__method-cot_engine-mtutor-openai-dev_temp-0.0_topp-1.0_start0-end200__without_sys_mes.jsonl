From clue 8, we know that the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in either the first, second, fourth, or fifth house.\n9. From clue 9, we know that the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in either the first, second, or third house.\n10. From clue 10, we know that the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the third house.\n11. From clue 11, we know that there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the pianist lives. Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the pianist cannot be in the second house. Therefore, the pianist must be in either the first or fourth house. If the pianist is in the first house, then the person eating a banana must be in the fourth house, which is not possible (from clue 2). Therefore, the pianist must be in the fourth house and the person eating a banana must be in the first house.\n12. From clue 12, we know that the guitarist does not live in the third house. Therefore, the guitarist must be in either the first, second, fourth, or fifth house.\n13. From clue 13, we know that the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist. Since the person who had pizza is not in the fifth house (from clue 15), the person who had pizza must be in the second or third house. If the person who had pizza is in the second house, then the saxophonist must be in the first house, which is not possible (from clue 7). Therefore, the person who had pizza must be in the third house and the saxophonist must be in the first house.\n14. From clue 14, we know that the person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person eating apples is in the third house and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the only possible location for the person who has a carnations arrangement is the first house.\n15. Therefore, the final arrangement is:\n- First house: person with carnations arrangement, percussionist, fried rice, \n- Second house: person with daffodils bouquet, violinist, pizza, banana,\n- Third house: person eating apples, pianist, spaghetti, kiwis,\n- Fourth house: person eating grilled cheese, guitarist, stew, grapes,\n- Fifth house: person eating mangos, saxophonist, percussionist, lilies.\n\nAnswer:\nThe person who had pizza lives in the third house."}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 931, "prompt_tokens": 581, "total_tokens": 1512}, "prompt": "Q: There are 5 houses in a row, numbered 1 on the left to 5 on the right.

From clue 3, we know that there are two houses between where the pianist lives and where the person wearing sandals lives. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the first house, the person wearing sandals cannot be in the second or third house. Therefore, the person wearing sandals must be in the fourth or fifth house. Since the person eating grapes cannot be in the first house (clue 4) and the person eating apples is in the fourth house (clue 12), the person wearing sandals must be in the fifth house. Therefore, the pianist must be in the third house.\n6. From clue 7, we know that the fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. Since the saxophonist is in the fifth house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fourth house.\n7. From clue 13, we know that the person eating oranges lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the fourth house, the person eating oranges must be in the third house.\n8. From clue 5, we know that the person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. Since the person eating oranges is in the third house, the person who likes green must be in the second house.\n9. From clue 1, we know that the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who likes blue. Since the person who likes green is in the second house, the person who likes blue must be in the third house.\n10. From clue 11, we know that the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who is wearing sandals is in the fifth house, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the fourth house.\n11. From clue 9, we know that the person who is eating oranges and the person who is wearing loafers live directly next to each other. Since the person who is wearing sandals is in the fifth house, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the fourth house.\n12. From clue 8, we know that the person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana. Since the person who is wearing high heels is in the fourth house, the person who likes white must be in the second or third house. However, since the person who likes blue is in the third house (clue 1), the person who likes white must be in the second house. Therefore, the person who is eating a banana must be in the fifth house.\n13. From clue 10, we know that the person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the fifth house, the history book buff must be in the fourth house.\n14. From clue 16, we know that the science fiction book fanatic and the cellist live directly next to each other. Since the cellist is not in the first or second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house.\n15. From clue 6, we know that there are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.

Combining clues 1 and 4, we can deduce that the mystery book reader lives in the first house, the person who has a television lives in the second house, and the history book buff lives in the third house.\n5. From clue 3, we know that the person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a television lives in the second house and the history book buff lives in the third house, the person who has a phone must live in the first house. Therefore, the person who has a computer must live in the third house.\n6.
