The people in these houses have different characteristics:\n - Each person has a different kind of car: one owns an SUV, one owns a sedan, one drives a convertible, one drives a minivan, and one drives a truck\n - Each person has a favorite color: one likes red, one likes yellow, one likes green, one likes white, and one likes blue\n - Each person is wearing different shoes: one is wearing running shoes, one is wearing boots, one is wearing high heels, one is wearing sandals, and one is wearing loafers\n\nClue(s):\n1. There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.\n2. The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.\n3. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.\n4. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.\n5. The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.\n6. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.\n7. There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.\n8. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.\n9. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.\n10. There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.\n11. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.\n\nWhat is the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives?\n  choice: 2\n  choice: 5\n  choice: 3\n  choice: 1\n  choice: 4\n\nYour output should be of the following format:\n\nAnswer:\nThe house number here.\n\nAnswer: 1\n---\nFeedback: The answer is correct.\n\nTo further explain the solution, let's analyze the clues:\n\n1. Loafers and minivan have one house between them.\n2. The truck is not in house 4.\n3. The truck is to the left of the sandals.\n4. Red is to the right of yellow.\n5. Loafers are to the left of the truck.\n6. Blue is in house 5.\n7. Sedan and running shoes have two houses between them.\n8. Boots are to the left of the truck.\n9. White is in house 4.\n10. Green and truck have one house between them.\n11. SUV is not in house 1.\n\nFrom clues 6 and 9, we know that house 4 is white and house 5 is blue. Since red is to the right of yellow (clue 4), yellow must be in house 1 or 2, and red must be in house 3 or 4. Since house 4 is white, yellow must be in house 1, and red must be in house 3. This leaves house 2 as green.\n\nSince there is one house between green and the truck (clue 10), the truck must be in house 4. This means the person wearing sandals is in house 5 (clue 3), and the person wearing loafers is in house 2 (clue 5). The person wearing boots must be in house 1 (clue 8), as it is the only remaining option.\n\nSo, the person who is wearing boots lives in house number 1.\n---\nBased on your initial answer and the subsequent feedback, revise the answer.
