You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition.

The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words.

Now let's think of a hint that can link \"green\" and \"hospital\" without causing confusion with other words in the list.\nMemory Champion: One possible hint could be \"environment\", as green is often associated with environmentalism and hospitals are concerned with maintaining a clean environment. However, this hint might be too broad and could potentially cause confusion with other words in the list.\nAI Assistant (you): How about the hint \"healing\"? Green is often associated with healing and growth, and hospitals are places where people go to heal.

You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

(3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding.

The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words.
