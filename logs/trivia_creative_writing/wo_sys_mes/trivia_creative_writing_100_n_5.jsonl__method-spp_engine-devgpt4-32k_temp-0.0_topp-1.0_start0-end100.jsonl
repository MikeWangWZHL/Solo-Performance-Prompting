Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12.

The course was unlike any they had seen before, with orange golf balls scattered across the lush green landscape. Intrigued, they decided to learn more about this strange game.\n\nAs they explored the course, they stumbled upon a hidden cave filled with treasures from faraway lands. Among the treasures, they found a collection of vinyl records from the 80s and 90s, all bearing the label \"Atlantic Records.\" Mowgli was particularly drawn to the music of Phil Collins, whose songs echoed through the jungle as they continued their adventure.\n\nDeeper into the cave, they discovered another set of records from the 1950s and 1960s, labeled \"Chess Records.\" The legendary Chuck Berry's music filled the air, and Mowgli, Baloo, and Bagheera couldn't help but dance to the rhythm.\n\nAs they ventured further, they came across a beautiful painting of a woman named Debbie Rowe. The painting was signed by none other than Michael Jackson, who, according to the inscription, had been married to Debbie. Mowgli and his friends marveled at the connection between the King of Pop and the mysterious woman in the painting.\n\nFinally, they found a map that led them to a hidden city deep within the jungle. The city was named \"Pittsburgh,\" after the British Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder. The city was a harmonious blend of nature and civilization, where animals and humans lived together in peace.\n\nMowgli, Baloo, and Bagheera returned to their jungle home, their hearts filled with the

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words.

Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1.

One of the questions was about the movie \"Dressed to Kill,\" which starred Michael Caine as a murderous transvestite psychiatrist. The Kids were amazed by the plot and decided to watch the movie together after the trivia night.\n\nAnother question was about Denis Law, who famously scored six goals in a match but still ended up on the losing team in a 1961 FA Cup tie. The Cabbage Patch Kids were inspired by his perseverance and decided to form their own soccer team.\n\nThe final question of the night was about Adam Smith, the economist who wrote \"The Wealth of Nations.\" The Kids were fascinated by his ideas and decided to start a little economy of their own in the Cabbage Patch.\n\nThe trivia night was a huge success, and the Cabbage Patch Kids learned a lot of new and interesting facts. They couldn't wait for the next trivia night with their friend, the Lone Ranger.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\n\nOnce upon a time in the Cabbage Patch, the Kids were preparing for a big trivia night.

Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding.

To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Inside, they found outfits that resembled the famous Ghostbusters from the 1980s - Dr. Stantz, Dr. Spengler, and Dr. Venkman.\n\nExcited by their new attire, the trolls decided to form their own team called the \"Trollbusters.\" They set out on a mission to protect their land from any supernatural threats. Their first task was to investigate strange occurrences at an old dairy farm. The farmer had been using rennet to make curds and whey, but something had gone wrong, and the cheese had come to life!\n\nAs the Trollbusters arrived at the farm, they discovered that the cheese monsters were actually being controlled by an evil spirit. This spirit was none other than the ghost of Georges Pompidou, who had once been the French President from 1959 to 1969. He had returned to seek revenge on those who had forgotten his legacy.\n\nThe Trollbusters knew they had to act fast. They used their knowledge of London's history and created a trap using the design of the first escalators installed in Harrods department store in 1898. They lured the cheese monsters and the vengeful spirit of Pompidou onto the makeshift escalator, which carried them into a containment unit.\n\nWith the evil spirit and cheese monsters captured, the Trollbusters saved the magical land from chaos.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1.

Firenze, being a wise and adventurous creature, decided to embark on a journey to find the Grail and unlock its secrets.\n\nDuring his travels, Firenze encountered a quirky couple, Penelope and Richard, who were lost in the icy wilderness.

Bubble, played by Jane Horrocks, was a resourceful and witty companion, and she joined the group in their quest for the Holy Grail.\n\nOne day, while navigating through a treacherous glacier, they met Hazell, a cockney private detective portrayed by Nicholas Ball. Hazell had been hired by Terry Venables to find the Holy Grail and was eager to join forces with Firenze and his companions.\n\nTogether, the unlikely group of adventurers braved the harsh Ice Age climate, battled prehistoric creatures, and finally reached Rosslyn Chapel. There, they discovered the Holy Grail, and with its power, they were able to return Penelope, Richard, and Bubble to their respective worlds. Firenze and Hazell, now close friends, continued to explore the mysteries of the Ice Age, their bond forged by the incredible journey they had shared.\n\nStory Writer: Let's check if the story is short, coherent, and incorporates the answers to the 5 questions.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first.

Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12.

It was the Beast, who had been cursed by a witch and turned into a creature made of lithium, the lightest metal under standard conditions. The Beast was seeking true love to break the curse and return to his human form.\n\nBeauty, seeing the kindness in the Beast's eyes, decided to help him.

Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words.

One day, he stumbled upon a mysterious book lying on the ground. The book was written by an author from South Africa named J.R.R. Tolkien. Intrigued, Bambi decided to read the book and learn about the world beyond the forest.\n\nAs Bambi read, he discovered a story about a legendary horse race commentator named Peter O'Sullevan. Peter was known for his captivating voice, which brought excitement to the sport of horse racing. Bambi was fascinated by the idea of horse racing and wondered if the animals in his forest could organize a similar event.\n\nWhile pondering this idea, Bambi heard a catchy tune playing in the distance. He followed the sound and found a group of animals listening to an album called 'The Queen is Dead' by The Smiths. The music was enchanting, and Bambi couldn't help but dance along with his new friends.\n\nDuring the celebration, Bambi met an old wise owl who told him about a famous British Prime Minister named Margaret Thatcher. She once described Downing Street as 'One of the most precious jewels in the national heritage.' Bambi was amazed by the importance of this place and wished to visit it someday.\n\nAs the day came to an end, Bambi gathered around a campfire with his friends, listening to stories from a traveling theater troupe. They performed a play called 'The Winter's Tale' by William Shakespeare, featuring a character named Antigonus. Bambi was captivated by the tale and felt inspired by the adventures he had experienced that day."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "spp", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Author J.R.R.

Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.
