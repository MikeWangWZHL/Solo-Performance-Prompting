Simba was fascinated by the idea of humans traveling to the Moon and wondered if lions could ever achieve such a feat.\n\nAs they continued to explore the cave, they found a dusty old record player with a collection of vinyl records. Intrigued, they decided to play one of the records, which turned out to be a 60s No 1 hit called \"Downtown\" by Petula Clark. The catchy tune filled the cave, and the friends couldn't help but dance and sing along.\n\nIn another corner of the cave, they found a poster of a man named Jimi Hendrix, who was famous for setting fire to his guitar at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. Simba was amazed by the boldness of this act and wondered if he could ever be as fearless as Jimi in protecting his kingdom.\n\nAs they delved deeper into the cave, they discovered a tattered book that told the story of a brilliant detective named Perry Mason and his loyal secretary, Della Street. Simba admired the teamwork between Perry and Della and realized the importance of having trustworthy friends by his side.\n\nFinally, they found a sheet of music titled \"Sweet and Innocent and Too Young,\" which was a song by Donny Osmond. The friends decided to learn the song and perform it together, celebrating their youth and innocence.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Simba and his friends returned to the Pride Lands, their hearts filled with newfound knowledge and appreciation for the world beyond their kingdom. They knew that together, they could face any challenge and protect their home, just like the heroes they had learned about in the cave."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["On what date in 1969 did Neil Armstrong first set foot on the Moon?", "Who had a 60s No 1 with Downtown?", "Who set fire to his guitar at the Monterey Pop festival in 19676?", "Della Street was whose secretary?", "In music, who was Sweet and Innocent and Too Young?"], "answers": [["July 20", "20 July", "July 20th", "Jul 20", "20th July", "Historical anniversaries/July 20", "20 july", "jul 20", "historical anniversaries july 20", "july 20th", "july 20", "20th july"], ["Petula Clark", "Petula Clarke", "Pet clark", "Petula Sally Olwen Clark", "petula clarke", "petula sally olwen clark", "pet clark", "petula clark"], ["Hendrix", "Lithofayne Pridgeon", "Jimi hendrix", "Early life of jimi hendrix", "Villanova Junction", "James Marshall Hendrix", "Jimmi Hendrix", "Jimy Hendrix", "Johnny Allen Hendrix", "Jimmy hendrix", "Jimmy Hendricks", "Gypsy Sun and Rainbows", "Jimmy Hendrix", "Electric Church", "Janie Hendrix", "Early life of Jimi Hendrix", "Heaven Research", "Jim Hendrix", "Al Hendrix", "Gypsy Suns and Rainbows", "James Hendrix", "Jimi Hendrix", "johnny allen hendrix", "jimmy hendrix", "jim hendrix", "jimi hendrix", "jimy hendrix", "hendrix", "jimmy hendricks", "early life of jimi hendrix", "electric church", "gypsy suns and rainbows", "heaven research", "villanova junction", "james hendrix", "al hendrix", "james marshall hendrix", "gypsy sun and rainbows", "lithofayne pridgeon", "janie hendrix", "jimmi hendrix"], ["Perry Mason (film)", "Perry mason", "Perry Mason: The Case of the Defiant Daughter", "Perry Mason", "perry mason", "perry mason case of defiant daughter", "perry mason film"], ["Donny Osmond", "Donny & Marie in Las Vegas", "Donald Clark Osmond", "Donald Osmond", "Donnie Osmond", "donald osmond", "donald clark osmond", "donny marie in las vegas", "donnie osmond", "donny osmond"]], "question_ids": ["tc_954", "tc_1004", "tc_1020", "tc_1023", "tc_1028"], "topic": "Lion King"}}

One day, while exploring the ocean with his friends, Nemo stumbled upon a sunken ship. Inside the ship, they discovered a treasure chest filled with old records and memorabilia.\n\nNemo and his friends found a record of Woody Herman, who founded his own orchestra at the age of 29. They were amazed by the beautiful music that filled the ocean as they played the record on an old underwater gramophone. The fish couldn't help but dance to the rhythm of the music.\n\nAs they continued to explore the ship, they found a poster of Katharine Hepburn, who won her second Oscar for the movie \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.\" Nemo and his friends were fascinated by the world of humans and their art. They decided to reenact the movie, with Nemo playing the role of Katharine Hepburn. The fish had a great time pretending to be humans and acting out the story.\n\nWhile searching through the treasure chest, they also found a vinyl record of the 60s No. 1 hit \"This Diamond Ring\" by Gary Lewis and the Playboys. The fish loved the catchy tune and sang along as they swam through the ocean, spreading joy and happiness to all the sea creatures they encountered.\n\nAs Nemo and his friends continued their adventure, they stumbled upon a newspaper article about the Chernobyl disaster. The world first became aware of the disaster after detectors were triggered at a nuclear plant in Sweden. The fish were saddened by the news and realized the importance of taking care of their own environment to prevent such catastrophes from happening in the ocean.\n\nThe last item they found in the treasure chest was a book about the history of the Soviet Union. They learned about the leaders of the country, including the man who succeeded Brezhnev as Soviet premier, Yuri Andropov.

One day, while exploring the ocean with his friends, Nemo stumbled upon a sunken ship. Inside the ship, they discovered a treasure chest filled with old records and memorabilia.\n\nNemo and his friends found a record of Woody Herman, who founded his own orchestra at the age of 29. They were amazed by the beautiful music that filled the ocean as they played the record on an old underwater gramophone. The fish couldn't help but dance to the rhythm of the music.\n\nAs they continued to explore the ship, they found a poster of Katharine Hepburn, who won her second Oscar for the movie \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.\" Nemo and his friends were fascinated by the world of humans and their art. They decided to reenact the movie, with Nemo playing the role of Katharine Hepburn. The fish had a great time pretending to be humans and acting out the story.\n\nWhile searching through the treasure chest, they also found a vinyl record of the 60s No. 1 hit \"This Diamond Ring\" by Gary Lewis and the Playboys. The fish loved the catchy tune and sang along as they swam through the ocean, spreading joy and happiness to all the sea creatures they encountered.\n\nAs Nemo and his friends continued their adventure, they stumbled upon a newspaper article about the Chernobyl disaster. The world first became aware of the disaster after detectors were triggered at a nuclear plant in Sweden. The fish were saddened by the news and realized the importance of taking care of their own environment to prevent such catastrophes from happening in the ocean.\n\nThe last item they found in the treasure chest was a book about the history of the Soviet Union. They learned about the leaders of the country, including the man who succeeded Brezhnev as Soviet premier, Yuri Andropov. Nemo and his friends were intrigued by the complex history of the human world and vowed to learn more about it.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Nemo and his friends returned to the Great Barrier Reef, their hearts filled with the knowledge and stories they had discovered.

These questions were said to hold the key to a treasure that would bring prosperity and happiness to the entire land.\n\nTheir journey led them to the Emerald City, where they met the wise Wizard of Oz. The Wizard, intrigued by their quest, agreed to help them find the answers. He opened his magical atlas and began to search for clues.\n\nThe first question was about the country where Earl Spencer's acrimonious divorce settlement was heard. The Wizard flipped through the pages of his atlas and found the answer: England. With the first answer in hand, the group felt a surge of excitement and continued to the next question.\n\nThe second question asked which of the founders of United Artists had the last name nearest the beginning of the alphabet. The Wizard consulted his book of famous people and discovered that it was Charlie Chaplin. Dorothy and her friends were amazed by the Wizard's knowledge and eagerly awaited the answer to the third question.\n\nIn La Cage Aux Folles, they needed to know what La Cage Aux Folles was. The Wizard, being a fan of theater, knew the answer right away: it was a nightclub. The group was now more than halfway through their quest and could feel the treasure getting closer.\n\nThe fourth question was about the percentage of the Earth's surface covered by Europe. The Wizard, being a master of geography, calculated the answer to be approximately 6.8%. Dorothy and her friends marveled at the Wizard's intelligence and prepared for the final question.\n\nThe last question asked which European town gave its name to a Treaty that symbolizes closer economic links between European countries. The Wizard searched his atlas once more and found the answer: Maastricht.

These questions were said to hold the key to a treasure that would bring prosperity and happiness to the entire land.\n\nTheir journey led them to the Emerald City, where they met the wise Wizard of Oz. The Wizard, intrigued by their quest, agreed to help them find the answers. He opened his magical atlas and began to search for clues.\n\nThe first question was about the country where Earl Spencer's acrimonious divorce settlement was heard. The Wizard flipped through the pages of his atlas and found the answer: England. With the first answer in hand, the group felt a surge of excitement and continued to the next question.\n\nThe second question asked which of the founders of United Artists had the last name nearest the beginning of the alphabet. The Wizard consulted his book of famous people and discovered that it was Charlie Chaplin. Dorothy and her friends were amazed by the Wizard's knowledge and eagerly awaited the answer to the third question.\n\nIn La Cage Aux Folles, they needed to know what La Cage Aux Folles was. The Wizard, being a fan of theater, knew the answer right away: it was a nightclub. The group was now more than halfway through their quest and could feel the treasure getting closer.\n\nThe fourth question was about the percentage of the Earth's surface covered by Europe. The Wizard, being a master of geography, calculated the answer to be approximately 6.8%. Dorothy and her friends marveled at the Wizard's intelligence and prepared for the final question.\n\nThe last question asked which European town gave its name to a Treaty that symbolizes closer economic links between European countries. The Wizard searched his atlas once more and found the answer: Maastricht. With all five answers in hand, Dorothy and her friends thanked the Wizard for his help and set off to unlock the treasure.\n\nAs they reached the treasure's location, they used the answers to the questions as the key. The treasure chest opened, revealing a magical scroll that contained a spell to bring prosperity and happiness to the land of Oz. Dorothy and her friends returned to the Emerald City and shared the treasure with everyone, ensuring that the land of Oz would thrive for generations to come.\n\nAnd so, with the help of the wise Wizard of Oz and their own determination, Dorothy and her friends solved the mystery of the five questions and brought happiness and prosperity to their beloved land."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In which country was Earl Spencer's acrimonious divorce settlement heard?", "Which of the founders of United Artists had the last name nearest the beginning of the alphabet?", "In La Cage Aux Folles, what was La Cage Aux Folles?", "What percentage of the earth's surface is covered by Europe?", "Which European town gave its name to a Treaty which symbolizes closer economic links between European countries?"], "answers": [["South africa", "South Africa's", "Southafrica", "Third Republic (South Africa)", "Republiek van Suid-Afrika", "Sou'frica", "Zuid Afrika", "Zuid-Afrika", "ISO 3166-1:ZA", "South-African", "S Africa", "Zuid Africa", "Mzansi", "Afrique du sud", "Zuidafrika", "Ningizimu Afrika", "Capital of South Africa", "Suid-Afrika", "South-Africa", "Rep. of SOUTH AFRICA", "The Republic of South Africa", "Suid Africa", "Azania/South Africa", "S Afr", "Saffa", "South African", "Seth efrika", "South Africa", "Soufrica", "Republic of south africa", "South Africa\u00e0", "The Beloved Country", "S.

Wiggles was a curious and adventurous dog who loved to explore and learn new things. One day, while rummaging through his owner's bookshelf, he came across a book written by Robert Ludlum, the author of the Bourne trilogy. Wiggles was fascinated by the thrilling story and decided to learn more about the world of humans.\n\nAs he continued to explore, Wiggles stumbled upon a book about the Three Musketeers. He was already familiar with Athos and Porthos, but he was excited to learn about the third musketeer, Aramis. Wiggles admired their bravery and camaraderie and wished he could be a part of their adventures.\n\nOne day, while playing in the park, Wiggles met another dog who had an interesting feature \u2013 a small fifth claw on the side of his foot. Wiggles learned that this unique claw was called a dewclaw. Intrigued by this discovery, Wiggles decided to learn more about the anatomy of dogs and other animals.\n\nDuring his research, Wiggles came across a fascinating fact about humans \u2013 they wore shoes with laces that had a small plastic bit on the end called an aglet.

She wanted to make it a special night, so she decided to choose movies that featured some of the most iconic characters and moments in film history.\n\nAs she was browsing through her movie collection, she came across a film that featured the Dawes Tomes Mousley Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank. \"Ah, yes! Mary Poppins would be a perfect choice,\" she thought to herself. She knew her friends would love the whimsical story of the magical nanny and the adventures she had with the Banks family.\n\nNext, she found a movie that starred Robin Williams as a character named Adrian Cronauer. \"Good Morning Vietnam!\" she exclaimed. Strawberry Shortcake knew that her friends would enjoy the humor and heart of this film, as well as the incredible performance by the late, great Robin Williams.\n\nAs she continued to search, she stumbled upon the 1996 live-action version of 101 Dalmatians. \"Oh, I just love Glenn Close as Cruella de Vil!\" Strawberry Shortcake said to herself. She knew that her friends would be captivated by the thrilling story of the dognapping villainess and the brave puppies who outsmarted her.\n\nStrawberry Shortcake then found a classic film directed by Billy Wilder, starring the legendary Marilyn Monroe. \"The Seven Year Itch is a must-watch!\" she thought. She knew her friends would be fascinated by the iconic scene of Marilyn Monroe's white dress blowing up over a subway grate.\n\nFinally, she wanted to include a movie that featured a real-life event. She remembered watching Celebrity Big Brother on Red Nose Day in 2001 and how excited she was when Jack Dee won. She decided to include a documentary about the event, so her friends could learn more about the charity and the celebrities who participated.\n\nWith her movie selections complete, Strawberry Shortcake invited all her friends to her cozy little home for a night of laughter, adventure, and unforgettable moments in film history. As they gathered around the television, snacking on popcorn and berries, they marveled at the magic of movies and the joy they brought to their lives.

This shop was known for providing the perfect outfit for any adventure, and Mr. Benn believed it could help them find a way to defeat the trolls.\n\nUpon entering the shop, the Ghostbusters and Mr. Benn were greeted by a mysterious shopkeeper who presented them with a peculiar outfit. It was a milkman's uniform, complete with a milk bottle filled with a special enzyme called rennet. The shopkeeper explained that rennet was used to coagulate milk, turning it into curds and whey. He told them that this enzyme was the key to defeating the trolls.\n\nThe Ghostbusters and Mr. Benn were skeptical but decided to trust the shopkeeper's advice. They donned the milkman uniforms and ventured into the village, armed with bottles of rennet-filled milk. As they approached the trolls, they noticed that the creatures were repulsed by the smell of the rennet.\n\nTaking advantage of the trolls' weakness, the Ghostbusters and Mr. Benn splashed the rennet-filled milk onto the trolls, causing them to shriek in pain and flee the village. The villagers rejoiced as their homes were saved from the trolls' destruction.\n\nTo celebrate their victory, the Ghostbusters, Mr. Benn, and the villagers decided to visit London, where they marveled at the city's first escalators, installed in 1898 at Harrods department store. As they ascended and descended the escalators, they couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and gratitude for the magical adventure that had brought them all together.\n\nFrom that day on, the village remained troll-free, and the Ghostbusters and Mr. Benn continued to embark on many more adventures, always remembering the power of friendship and the mysterious magic of rennet."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["How were Dr Stantz, Dr Spengler and Dr Venkman better known in the 1980's?", "General Charles de Gaulle was French President 1959 to 1969.

He introduced himself as Tommy Lee Jones, the actor who played her father in the 2004 film \"The Missing.\" Intrigued by their quest, Tommy decided to join the Minions in their search for the treasure.\n\nThe group ventured through the bustling streets of London, following the path of the underground river that rose in Hampstead, flowed through St. Pancras, down Farringdon Street, and entered the Thames by Blackfriars Bridge. This river was known as the Fleet River, and the Minions believed that the treasure was hidden somewhere along its banks.\n\nAs they continued their search, they encountered a woman who had just won the Best Actress Oscar for the 1988 film, The Accused. Her name was Jodie Foster, and she was eager to help the Minions in their quest. With her acting skills and determination, she proved to be a valuable addition to the team.\n\nOne day, while exploring the area near the Fleet River, the Minions and their newfound friends stumbled upon a guarded station office. They knew that the treasure must be hidden inside, but they needed a way to break in without being detected. That's when they met a talented dancer who had only one notable film cameo, appearing with Sean Connery in the 1979 movie The First Great Train Robbery. His name was Wayne Sleep, and he was an expert at stealth and agility.\n\nWith Wayne's help, the Minions, Tommy, Jodie, and Wayne successfully broke into the guarded station office and discovered the hidden treasure of Rudolph Valentino.

They had heard stories of his legendary charm and wanted to learn his secrets to impress their fellow Minions.\n\nAs they began their journey, they stumbled upon a mysterious old man who claimed to be the father of Cate Blanchett. He introduced himself as Tommy Lee Jones, the actor who played her father in the 2004 film \"The Missing.\" Intrigued by their quest, Tommy decided to join the Minions in their search for the treasure.\n\nThe group ventured through the bustling streets of London, following the path of the underground river that rose in Hampstead, flowed through St. Pancras, down Farringdon Street, and entered the Thames by Blackfriars Bridge. This river was known as the Fleet River, and the Minions believed that the treasure was hidden somewhere along its banks.\n\nAs they continued their search, they encountered a woman who had just won the Best Actress Oscar for the 1988 film, The Accused. Her name was Jodie Foster, and she was eager to help the Minions in their quest. With her acting skills and determination, she proved to be a valuable addition to the team.\n\nOne day, while exploring the area near the Fleet River, the Minions and their newfound friends stumbled upon a guarded station office. They knew that the treasure must be hidden inside, but they needed a way to break in without being detected. That's when they met a talented dancer who had only one notable film cameo, appearing with Sean Connery in the 1979 movie The First Great Train Robbery. His name was Wayne Sleep, and he was an expert at stealth and agility.\n\nWith Wayne's help, the Minions, Tommy, Jodie, and Wayne successfully broke into the guarded station office and discovered the hidden treasure of Rudolph Valentino.

She was a curious and adventurous young lady who loved to explore the city and learn about its history.\n\nOne day, while wandering through the bustling streets, she stumbled upon a hidden alley that led to a mysterious old building. The sign above the door read \"St. Trinian's School for Girls,\" and it piqued her interest. She had heard tales of this fictional girls' boarding school created by the cartoonist Ronald Searle and couldn't believe it was real.\n\nAs she entered the school, she was greeted by a kind and gentle man named Mr. Chips, who was played by Martin Clunes in the 2002 TV adaptation of \"Goodbye Mr. Chips.\" He welcomed her with a warm smile and offered to show her around the school.\n\nAs they walked through the halls, Princess Penelope couldn't help but notice the students' enthusiasm for learning. She asked Mr. Chips, \"Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?\" Mr. Chips chuckled and replied, \"Indeed, they are, Princess. Here at St. Trinian's, we believe in nurturing the minds of our students and encouraging their curiosity.\"\n\nAs they continued their tour, they came across a beautiful garden filled with vibrant flowers and a serene pond. Sitting by the pond was a lonely frog, who looked up at the princess with sad eyes. Feeling a sudden connection to the creature, Princess Penelope approached the frog and asked, \"Are you going to come quietly, or do I have to use earplugs?\"\n\nThe frog, surprised by her question, replied, \"I will come quietly, Princess, for I am a magical frog, and I need your help.\" He explained that he was once a prince, but a wicked witch had cursed him, turning him into a frog. The only way to break the curse was for a princess to kiss him.\n\nPrincess Penelope, moved by the frog's story, leaned down and gently kissed him on the head. In an instant, the frog transformed back into a handsome prince. Overjoyed, the prince thanked her and vowed to repay her kindness.\n\nTogether, they returned to the city and shared their story with the people. The citizens celebrated the breaking of the curse and the newfound friendship between the princess and the prince. From that day on, Princess Penelope and the prince worked together to promote education and curiosity in the city, ensuring that the question \"Is our children learning?\" would always be answered with a resounding \"Yes!\""], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 3, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What was the capital of the United States between 1785 and 1790??", "Which fictional girls' boarding school was created by the cartoonist Ronald Searle", "Who played the character Mr Chips in the 2002 TV adaptation of Goodbye Mr Chips", "Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?", "Are you going to come quietly, or do I have to use earplugs?"], "answers": [["New Yourk State", "State of N.Y.", "US-NY", "N Y", "The state of NY", "NewYork", "NYS", "Neo York", "NY state", "Nova York", "State of new york", "Ny", "New york", "Nueva York (estado)", "N Y state", "New York (state)", "U.S. state of New York", "New York state", "New York, U.S.", "State New York", "N\u00fdja-J\u00f3rv\u00edk", "Newyork", "NEW YORK", "State of N.
