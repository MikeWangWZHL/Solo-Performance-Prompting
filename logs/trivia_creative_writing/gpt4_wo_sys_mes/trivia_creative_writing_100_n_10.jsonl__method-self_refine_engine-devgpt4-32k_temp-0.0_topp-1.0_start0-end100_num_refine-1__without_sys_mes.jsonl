The information provided is accurate, and the story flows smoothly from one event to another, connecting the various elements in a creative and entertaining manner.\n\nOne minor correction is needed: the youngest brother in the Beach Boys was actually Dennis Wilson, not Carl Wilson. This can be easily fixed by replacing \"Carl Wilson\" with \"Dennis Wilson\" in the story.\n\nOverall, the story is well-written and enjoyable, demonstrating a clever way to integrate diverse pieces of information into a single narrative.\n---\nBased on your initial response and the subsequent feedback, revise the response.

The event was organized to celebrate the achievements of various sports and entertainment legends.\n\nAs Wonder Woman entered the venue, she was greeted by a large banner showcasing the incredible accomplishments of Gert Fredriksson, who had won six Olympic gold medals in various kayaking events. She was also amazed to learn about Mike Hawthorn, a former Formula One motor racing world champion, who had won 3 of his 45 races.\n\nWhile mingling with the guests, Wonder Woman met the controversial author of the 1926 book My Life and Loves, Frank Harris, which was originally banned in the US. They discussed the importance of freedom of speech and artistic expression.\n\nAs the evening progressed, the guests were entertained by a live performance of Blondie's last UK No. 1 hit of the 80s, \"The Tide is High.\" Wonder Woman couldn't help but dance along to the catchy tune.\n\nDuring a break in the festivities, Wonder Woman struck up a conversation with the legendary actress Anne Bancroft, who was born in the 1930s. They shared stories of their experiences in the entertainment industry and the challenges they faced as strong, independent women.\n\nLater in the evening, Wonder Woman met supermodel Cindy Crawford, who proudly introduced her first son, named after rock star Jimi Hendrix. They bonded over their shared admiration for the musician's talent and influence.\n\nAs the charity auction began, Wonder Woman was captivated by a stunning dress designed by Victor Edelstein, which had once belonged to Princess Diana. The dress fetched the highest bid of the night, with all proceeds going to support the arts and education.\n\nTowards the end of the event, Wonder Woman had the opportunity to speak with one of the co-founders of al Fatah, a Palestinian political party established in 1957. They engaged in a thoughtful discussion about the complexities of global politics and the importance of diplomacy.\n\nHowever, the night took an unexpected turn when the event was suddenly flooded with unwanted and intrusive messages, much like the internet phenomenon known as Spam. Wonder Woman quickly realized that a villain was attempting to sabotage the event and sprang into action.\n\nUsing her incredible strength, agility, and intelligence, Wonder Woman swiftly defeated the villain and restored peace to the charity event. The guests were grateful for her heroic intervention, and the evening concluded with a renewed sense of unity and appreciation for the diverse accomplishments of all those in attendance."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 10}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In which events did Gert Fredriksson win six Olympic gold medals?", "How many of his 45 races did Mike Hawthorn, a former Formula One motor racing world champion, win?", "On the Internet what is Spam?", "In which year was the Juilliard School founded in New York?", "Who wrote My Life and Loves in 1926, originally banned in the US?", "What was Blondie's last UK No 1 of the 80s?", "In which decade of the 20th century was Anne Bancroft born?", "Which rock star did Cindy Crawford name her first son after?", "Who designed the dress which made the most at Diana's dress auction?", "Which Palestinian co-founded al Fatah in 1957?"], "answers": [["Flatwater", "Canoeing", "Canoeist", "Canoers", "Canoe flatwater racing", "Canoing", "Paddler", "Canoer", "Flatwater canoeing", "Competitive canoeing", "canoeing", "canoeist", "canoer", "paddler", "canoe flatwater racing", "canoers", "flatwater", "canoing", "competitive canoeing", "flatwater canoeing"], ["3", "Three", "three", "three", "3"], ["Junk mail (disambiguation)", "Junkmail", "Junkmailing", "Junk mail", "Junk Mail", "junkmail", "junkmailing", "junk mail", "junk mail disambiguation"], ["1905", "one thousand, nine hundred and five", "one thousand nine hundred and five", "1905"], ["Frank Harris", "frank harris"], ["Midtribulation rapture", "Midtribulationism", "Pre-tribulation", "Pre-tribulation rapture", "Rapture", "Pretribulation rapture", "Mid-tribulation rapture", "Rapture (Protestant belief)", "The Teaching of the rapture", "Pretribulationistism", "Pre Tribulation", "Pre-tribulational", "Pre-trib", "teaching of rapture", "pre tribulation rapture", "rapture protestant belief", "midtribulation rapture", "rapture", "pretribulation rapture", "pre tribulational", "mid tribulation rapture", "midtribulationism", "pretribulationistism", "pre trib", "pre tribulation"], ["1930\u2019s", "Thirties", "1930s literature", "Nineteen-thirties", "1930\u20131939", "1930-1939", "'30s", "1930s", "1930's", "%6030s", "1930s (decade)", "The Thirties", "1930\u20131939", "30s", "nineteen thirties", "1930 1939", "thirties", "1930s literature", "1930s decade", "1930s", "1930 s", "6030s"], ["Presley", "Pressley", "Pressly", "pressly", "presley", "pressley"], ["Victor Edelstein", "victor edelstein"], ["Yasir Arafat", "Yasir 'Arafat", "Jassir Arafat", "Abu Ammar", "Yasser 'Arafat", "\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0624\u0648\u0641 \u0639\u0631\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646\u064a", "Ab\u016b %60amm\u0101r", "Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat Al Qudua Al Husseini", "Yaser Arafat", "Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat al-Qudwa al-Husseini", "Ashraf al-Kurdi", "Muhammad Abd ar-Rauf al-Qudwah al-Husayni", "Abu Amar", "Mohammed Abdel-Raouf Arafat As Qudwa al-Hussaeini", "Death of yasser arafat", "Yasser Arafet", "Yasser Arafat", "Death Of Yasser Arafat", "Yassir Arafat", "Death of Arafat", "Muhammed al-Qudwa al-Husseini", "Yasir Arafat (Disambiguation)", "Illness of Yasser Arafat", "Yassar Arafat", "death of yasser arafat", "\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0624\u0648\u0641 \u0639\u0631\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646\u064a", "yasir arafat disambiguation", "ab\u016b 60amm\u0101r", "yassir arafat", "illness of yasser arafat", "yassar arafat", "abu ammar", "muhammed al qudwa al husseini", "yasir arafat", "ashraf al kurdi", "muhammad abd ar rauf al qudwah al husayni", "yasser arafet", "yasser arafat", "yaser arafat", "mohammed abdel raouf arafat as qudwa al hussaeini", "mohammed abdel rahman abdel raouf arafat al qudua al husseini", "mohammed abdel rahman abdel raouf arafat al qudwa al husseini", "death of arafat", "jassir arafat", "abu amar"]], "question_ids": ["tc_1730", "tc_1735", "tc_1754", "tc_1798", "tc_1816", "tc_1826", "tc_1865", "tc_1888", "tc_1921", "tc_1924"], "topic": "Wonder Woman"}}

She sought the help of a wise old sea witch, who told her about a magical place called La Cage Aux Folles. In this enchanted place, La Cage Aux Folles was a nightclub where people could transform into anything they desired. The sea witch offered Ariel a potion that would turn her into a human, but in exchange, she would have to give up her beautiful voice.\n\nDesperate to experience the human world, Ariel agreed to the deal and drank the potion. She emerged from the sea as a human, her legs wobbly and weak, but she was determined to explore this new world. As she wandered through the streets of London, she learned about the acrimonious divorce settlement of Earl Spencer, which was heard in the courts of England.\n\nAriel's journey led her to the bustling city of Budapest, the first European city to open an underground railway system in the 20th century. As she marveled at the trains speeding through the tunnels, she met a kind artist named Ub Iwerks, who first drew Mickey Mouse when Walt Disney first supplied the voice. Ariel and Ub became fast friends, and he taught her about the world of animation and storytelling.\n\nOne day, Ariel came across a novel called \"The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles,\" written by the talented actress Julie Andrews. The story captivated her, and she realized that even without her voice, she could still share her own stories and experiences with others.\n\nAriel's adventures in the human world taught her the power of creativity, friendship, and the importance of staying true to oneself. With her newfound knowledge, she returned to her underwater kingdom, where she used her experiences to inspire and unite the creatures of the sea. And so, the Little Mermaid lived happily ever after, her heart full of love and her mind full of stories to share with the world."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 7, "question_count": 10}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In which country was Earl Spencer's acrimonious divorce settlement heard?", "Which of the founders of United Artists had the last name nearest the beginning of the alphabet?", "In La Cage Aux Folles, what was La Cage Aux Folles?", "What percentage of the earth's surface is covered by Europe?", "Which European town gave its name to a Treaty which symbolizes closer economic links between European countries?", "Which home of champagne in France was also where the German High Command surrendered in WWII?", "Which was the first European city this century to open an underground railway system?", "Who first drew Mickey Mouse when ?Disney first supplied the voice?", "Which actress wrote the novel The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles?", "Who was the star of the film based on the record Harper Valley PTA by Jeannie C Riley?"], "answers": [["South africa", "South Africa's", "Southafrica", "Third Republic (South Africa)", "Republiek van Suid-Afrika", "Sou'frica", "Zuid Afrika", "Zuid-Afrika", "ISO 3166-1:ZA", "South-African", "S Africa", "Zuid Africa", "Mzansi", "Afrique du sud", "Zuidafrika", "Ningizimu Afrika", "Capital of South Africa", "Suid-Afrika", "South-Africa", "Rep. of SOUTH AFRICA", "The Republic of South Africa", "Suid Africa", "Azania/South Africa", "S Afr", "Saffa", "South African", "Seth efrika", "South Africa", "Soufrica", "Republic of south africa", "South Africa\u00e0", "The Beloved Country", "S.

Woody answered, \"That would be Heinrich Himmler, Mr. Potato Head.\" Mr. Potato Head shuddered at the mention of such a notorious figure.\n\nSlinky Dog, curious about geography, asked, \"Which state on the Gulf of Mexico is nearest the end of the alphabet?\" Woody thought for a moment and responded, \"That would be Texas, Slinky.\" Slinky wagged his tail, proud to know more about his home state.\n\nRex, the lovable dinosaur, wanted to know more about airports. \"Truax Field International Airport is in which US state?\" he inquired. Woody replied, \"It's in Wisconsin, Rex.\" Rex roared with excitement, eager to learn more about the world outside Andy's room.\n\nThe toys were enjoying their history lesson, and Hamm the piggy bank asked about the 1904 Olympics. \"How many of the 23 track and field titles were won by Americans?\" Woody thought for a moment and said, \"Americans won 21 of those titles, Hamm.\" Hamm snorted in amazement at the athletic prowess of his fellow Americans.\n\nBo Peep, interested in geography as well, asked, \"The Black Hills lie between which two rivers?\" Woody answered, \"They lie between the Cheyenne and Belle Fourche rivers, Bo Peep.\" Bo Peep smiled, imagining the beautiful landscape of the Black Hills.\n\nAs the quiz continued, Jessie the cowgirl wanted to know about the history of aviation. \"In what year was the first in-flight movie shown on an internal flight in the USA?\" she asked. Woody replied, \"That happened in 1961, Jessie.\" Jessie tipped her hat, impressed by the progress in aviation technology.\n\nBullseye, Jessie's trusty steed, was curious about a famous event from the 1960s. \"Who did Jack Ruby shoot in November 1963?\" he asked. Woody responded, \"Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald, Bullseye.\" Bullseye neighed solemnly, acknowledging the gravity of the event.\n\nBuzz Lightyear, always fascinated by speed and flight, asked, \"Who was the first American to travel faster than the speed of sound?\" Woody answered, \"That would be Chuck Yeager, Buzz.\" Buzz's eyes widened in admiration, and he exclaimed, \"To infinity and beyond! What an incredible achievement!\"\n\nFinally, the Little Green Men wanted to know about a famous journalist. \"Who was the first US president Barbara Walters interviewed?\" they asked in unison. Woody replied, \"She interviewed President Richard Nixon, Little Green Men.\" The Little Green Men exchanged glances, amazed by the accomplishments of the human race.\n\nWith their history quiz complete, the toys felt more knowledgeable and prepared for any future adventures. They thanked Woody for his wisdom and continued to learn and grow together in Andy's room, eagerly awaiting the next opportunity to expand their knowledge of the world."], "parsing_success_flag":

The information provided is accurate, and the story flows well, connecting the various elements in a creative and entertaining manner.\n\nOne area that could be improved is the transition between the different locations Shrek visits during his party planning. The story could benefit from smoother transitions that explain why Shrek is traveling to these specific places, rather than simply listing them as stops on his journey.\n\nAdditionally, while the story does a good job of weaving the answers to the questions into the narrative, some of the connections feel a bit forced. For example, the inclusion of the motorized ambulance and the mock election could be better integrated into the story to make them feel like more natural elements of Shrek's party.\n\nOverall, the response is well-written and enjoyable to read, with only minor improvements needed to enhance the coherence and flow of the story.\n---\nBased on your initial response and the subsequent feedback, revise the response.

He had recently discovered that he was distantly related to the famous orchestral conductor, Daniel Barenboim, who was married to one of the subjects of the film Hillary and Jackie. Shrek was fascinated by this connection and decided to throw a party to celebrate his newfound heritage.\n\nAs Shrek began planning the festivities, he stumbled upon a dusty old book in his swamp. To his surprise, it was the first Tarzan novel, published in 1912. Shrek was thrilled to find such a treasure and decided to incorporate a Tarzan theme into his party.\n\nWhile searching for party supplies, Shrek traveled to Belgium, the country where motorized ambulances were first used. He had heard about a unique antique market there, where he hoped to find some special items for his party. As he explored the market, he came across a beautifully restored motorized ambulance. Shrek thought it would be a great idea to have it at the party for guests to explore and learn about the history of emergency transportation.\n\nDuring his journey, Shrek visited the oldest continually inhabited city in the world, the Syrian city of Aleppo. He marveled at the ancient architecture and decided to model his party decorations after the beautiful designs he saw there. He met a talented artist who agreed to create custom decorations for his celebration.\n\nShrek's next stop was Red Square in Moscow, where he admired the stunning Saint Basil's Cathedral. Inspired by its beauty, Shrek commissioned a local baker to create a replica of the cathedral as a magnificent cake for his party.\n\nWhile researching his family tree, Shrek discovered that he was also related to Catherine Parr, the wife of Henry VIII who had already married twice before she became queen and married for a fourth time after Henry's death.

The factory was owned by a brilliant scientist named Dr. Evaporatus, who was an expert in the field of mathematics, specifically the four fundamental principles: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nOne day, Dr. Evaporatus discovered a new process to create a special type of glass that could change its state from liquid to gas, a phenomenon he named \"vaporization.\" This discovery caught the attention of the city's fastest animal on two legs, the Incredible Ostrich.\n\nThe Incredible Ostrich was fascinated by this new invention and decided to visit the factory. Upon arrival, he noticed that the factory was surrounded by a beautiful garden filled with mosses, which belonged to the bryophyte part of the plant kingdom. The garden was also home to a family of squirrels, who reared their young, called kittens, in a nest called a drey.\n\nAs the Incredible Ostrich explored the garden, he stumbled upon a lodge constructed by beavers. These industrious mammals used the lodge to store food, rear their young, and pass the winter. The lodge was surrounded by various plants that grew in water or water-logged conditions, known as hydrophytes.\n\nCurious about the connection between the factory and the garden, the Incredible Ostrich asked Dr. Evaporatus for an explanation. The scientist revealed that the secret behind the special glass was the use of a substance extracted from the hydrophytes, which allowed the glass to undergo vaporization.\n\nDr. Evaporatus also shared that he had been studying the reproductive process of the plants in the garden. He explained that when the egg is released from the ovary, a structure called the corpus luteum is left behind.\n\nThe Incredible Ostrich was amazed by the connection between nature and science in the city of Incredibles. Before leaving the factory, he learned one last fascinating fact from Dr. Evaporatus: the scientific name for the heart's pacemaker is the sinoatrial node.\n\nWith newfound knowledge and appreciation for the wonders of science, the Incredible Ostrich continued his adventures in the city of Incredibles, always eager to learn more about the world around him.\n---\nFeedback: The response accurately incorporates the answers to the 10 questions and creates a coherent story set in the city of Incredibles. The story revolves around the Incredible Ostrich and Dr. Evaporatus, who share knowledge about various scientific facts. The story is engaging and informative, making it an enjoyable read.\n\nHowever, there are a few minor improvements that could be made to enhance the story:\n\n1. The story could benefit from a more engaging opening line to immediately capture the reader's attention.\n2. The story could be more connected to the Incredibles universe, perhaps by including some familiar characters or settings from the movies.\n3. The story could include a more distinct conflict or challenge for the characters to overcome, which would add depth and excitement to the narrative.\n\nOverall, the response does a great job of weaving the answers to the questions into a coherent and interesting story. With a few minor adjustments, the story could be even more engaging and enjoyable for readers.\n---\nBased on your initial response and the subsequent feedback, revise the response.

Nemo knew he had to act fast to save his friends and find the treasure.\n\nAs he entered the cave, he encountered a group of five-legged creatures who had damaged the 1250-mile-long Coral Reef, a wonder of the underwater world. They challenged Nemo to a race around the Earth, which has an approximate circumference of 24,901 miles. Nemo, being a fast swimmer, accepted the challenge and won, earning their respect.\n\nUpon reaching Ovulina, she presented Nemo with a series of questions. The first question was about a common mineral used to make casts, moulds, blackboard chalk, and plaster of Paris. Nemo, remembering his father's teachings, answered correctly: \"Gypsum!\"\n\nNext, Ovulina asked about a star as bright as 23 Suns, orbited by the Pup. Nemo thought hard and recalled the name of the star: \"Sirius!\"\n\nOvulina then asked Nemo to name the three primary colours of light. Nemo confidently replied, \"Red, green, and blue!\"\n\nFor her final question, Ovulina asked Nemo about the second lightest chemical element. Nemo hesitated for a moment but then remembered: \"Helium!\"\n\nImpressed by Nemo's knowledge, Ovulina granted him access to the treasure. Before leaving, she asked Nemo one last question: \"Used in mathematics, what is the value of Pi to three decimal places?\" Nemo smiled and replied, \"3.141!\"\n\nWith the treasure in his possession, Nemo returned to his friends and used it to restore the damaged Coral Reef and reverse the eutrophication. The vibrant colours and diverse marine life of the underwater world flourished once again, and Nemo became a hero, proving that knowledge and determination can overcome any obstacle."],

Your revised response:\n"}], "unwrapped_output": ["In the dystopian world of the Hunger Games, a young boy named Jonah found solace in watching old films from the past. His favorite was a 1993 film where a boy, also named Jonah, wrote to a woman called Annie, asking her to meet his father at the Empire State Building on St. Valentine's Day. This film inspired Jonah to believe in love and hope, even in the darkest of times.\n\nOne day, while exploring the ruins of an old city, Jonah stumbled upon a working music player. He discovered a song from 1988 called \"Valentine,\" which became his anthem of hope. He would hum the tune as he navigated the treacherous world around him, always remembering the second most common word in written English: \"of.\" It reminded him that he was part of something bigger, and that love and hope could still exist.\n\nIn his travels, Jonah came across an old arcade game featuring ghosts called Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Clyde. He spent hours playing the game, finding joy in the simple pleasure of chasing and being chased by the colorful ghosts. It was a welcome distraction from the harsh reality of the Hunger Games.\n\nOne evening, Jonah found a tattered book titled \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" Intrigued, he read the story and learned about a cult film starring Harrison Ford that was based on the book. The story of a man hunting down rogue androids resonated with Jonah, as he too was constantly on the run from danger. The parallels between the film and his own life gave him a sense of connection to the past.\n\nAs the days went by, Jonah discovered an old ITV magazine style show that ran from 1968 to 1980. It featured presenters like Jenny Hanley, Mick Robertson, and Tommy Boyd. Watching the show transported Jonah to a time before the Hunger Games, when people could laugh and enjoy life without fear. The show served as a reminder of the humanity that still existed within him.\n\nOne day, while seeking shelter from a storm, Jonah found a DVD of the Disney cartoon film \"Robin Hood.\" He was delighted to see that Robin Hood was portrayed as an animal \u2013 a fox. The story of a hero fighting for justice and equality gave Jonah the strength to continue his own fight for survival. He drew inspiration from the courageous fox, vowing to be a hero in his own way.\n\nIn his darkest moments, Jonah would listen to the voice of Bob the Builder from the hit song \"Can We Fix It?\" The voice, provided by Neil Morrissey, was a beacon of hope and determination for Jonah. He would often repeat the song's lyrics to himself, reminding him that he could overcome any obstacle. The song became a symbol of resilience for him.\n\nJonah's journey took a surprising turn when he discovered a hidden stash of money. Among the bills, he found a note revealing that an actor had received 4 million dollars for his 10 minutes on screen in the film \"Superman.\" This fact astounded Jonah, as it was a stark contrast to the poverty and struggle he faced daily. The discovery made him realize the vast differences between the world he lived in and the world of the past.\n\nAs Jonah continued to navigate the Hunger Games, he found solace in the world of cricket. He learned that the score of 111 was known as a \"Nelson,\" and he adopted this number as his lucky charm. He would whisper \"Nelson\" to himself whenever he needed a boost of confidence or a reminder of the world beyond the Hunger Games.

However, there is a small mistake in the story: the pub is referred to as the Polar Express, which is not mentioned in the original questions. The pub should be referred to as having the longest name with 95 letters, but the name itself is not provided. To improve the response, the reference to the Polar Express should be removed or replaced with the actual name of the pub with 95 letters.\n\nAdditionally, the story could be improved by providing smoother transitions between the different topics discussed by the friends. In its current form, the story reads more like a list of facts rather than a natural conversation. Adding more dialogue and interaction between the characters could help make the story more engaging and realistic.\n---\nBased on your initial response and the subsequent feedback, revise the response.

The information provided is accurate, and the story flows well, with each character and element introduced in a logical manner. The story maintains a consistent theme of pets named after various famous people and events, which adds a unique and interesting twist to the narrative.\n\nOne area that could be improved is the transition between the discovery of the painting and the confrontation with Spector. The connection between the painting and the pets' motivation to confront Spector could be made clearer, as it currently seems a bit abrupt. Additionally, the story could benefit from a more detailed description of the pets' plan to defeat Spector, as well as the actual confrontation scene.\n\nOverall, the response is creative and well-written, successfully weaving the answers to the questions into a fun and entertaining story. With a few minor adjustments, the story could be even more engaging and enjoyable.\n---\nBased on your initial response and the subsequent feedback, revise the response. Your revised response:\n"}], "unwrapped_output": ["Once upon a time in a bustling city, there was a group of pets who lived a secret life when their owners were away. Among them were Hudson, a sophisticated dog named after the butler played by Gordon Jackson in Upstairs Downstairs, and LaToya, a sassy cat named after the Jackson who appeared in Celebrity Big Brother in January 2009.\n\nOne day, Hudson and LaToya decided to explore the city and stumbled upon a hidden alley where they met a trio of mischievous pets named Peter, Aldo, and Humphrey. These three were named after the actors Peter Ustinov, Aldo Ray, and Humphrey Bogart, who played escaped convicts in the 1955 comedy movie We're No Angels.\n\nAs they continued their adventure, they came across a majestic dog named Arthur, who was named after King Arthur, played by Richard Harris in the 1967 musical film Camelot. Arthur was known for his bravery and leadership among the pets in the city.\n\nDuring their journey, the group learned about a mysterious and dangerous cat named Spector, named after Phil Spector, who was convicted of the murder of Lana Clarkson in 2009. Spector was known to terrorize the pets in the city, and the group decided to put an end to his reign of terror.\n\nTo prepare for their mission, the pets sought guidance from two wise and experienced dogs named Philip and Charles, who were named after the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles, both of whom attended the public school Gordonstoun.\n\nAs they trained, they were inspired by the story of a brave golfer named \u00c1ngel, named after \u00c1ngel Cabrera, who won the Masters Tournament in 2009, following Phil Mickelson in 2006, Zach Johnson in 2007, and Trevor Immelman in 2008.\n\nOne day, while devising their plan to defeat Spector, the pets discovered a painting hidden in an old building. The painting, named \"The Persistence of Memory,\" depicted clocks oozing over a landscape and was created by Salvador Dali. The pets were inspired by the painting's message of time's relentless passage and realized that they needed to act quickly to save their fellow pets from Spector's terror.\n\nWith their newfound motivation, the pets set out to confront Spector at his hideout, which was located near Bagshot Park in Surrey, the residence of a well-known couple, the Earl and Countess of Wessex.\n\nUpon arriving at Spector's hideout, the pets discovered that it was eerily similar to 10 Rillington Place, the home of the notorious murderer John Christie. Undeterred, the brave group of pets devised a clever plan to lure Spector out of his lair by creating a distraction, allowing them to ambush and capture him.\n\nAs they executed their plan, the pets worked together seamlessly, using their unique skills and abilities to outsmart Spector. In the end, they successfully captured the dangerous cat and brought him to justice.\n\nWith Spector defeated, the pets returned to their homes, their secret lives continuing as they awaited their next adventure. The city's pets were now safe, and the group of friends had become legends among their fellow animals. Their tale of bravery and teamwork would be remembered for generations to come, inspiring pets everywhere to stand up against evil and protect their friends."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 9, "question_count": 10}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What was the surname of the butler played by Gordon Jackson in Upstairs Downstairs?", "Which Jackson appeared in Celebrity Big Brother in January 2009?", "The 1955 comedy movie We're No Angels centred on three escaped convicts.

Fred and Wilma were about to celebrate their first wedding anniversary, which was traditionally celebrated with paper. To commemorate the occasion, they decided to throw a party and invite all their friends and family.\n\nAs they were planning the party, they heard a catchy tune on the radio called \"Only You\" by The Flying Pickets, a British vocal group who had a Christmas no1 hit in 1983. Inspired by the song, they decided to have a music-themed party and invite a local band called The Mamelodi Sundowns, named after a South African football team, to perform at their celebration.\n\nFred went to the local newspaper stand to buy some papers to use as decorations and invitations. He noticed that the newspapers came in various sizes, with broadsheet being the largest and tabloid being smaller. He decided to buy the smallest size, called a Berliner, which was perfect for their paper-themed party.\n\nAs the party planning continued, Wilma discovered that a famous American female rap artist, film, and television actress had released a song called \"Paper\" in 1998.

Jane mentioned her love for the 2004 film \"The Missing,\" in which Tommy Lee Jones played Cate Blanchett's father. The story, set in 19th century New Mexico, followed the father and estranged daughter as they worked together to rescue her kidnapped child.\n\nJudy, on the other hand, was a fan of the 1988 film \"The Accused,\" for which Jodie Foster won the Best Actress Oscar. She admired the strong female lead and the powerful message the film conveyed.\n\nAs the party began, the Jetsons' home was transformed into a glamorous scene reminiscent of old Hollywood. The decorations included a replica of the London river Fleet, which flowed underground from Hampstead through St. Pancras, down Farringdon Street, and entered the Thames by Blackfriars Bridge.\n\nOne of the party's highlights was a dance performance by a talented dancer who had only one notable film cameo, appearing with Sean Connery in the 1979 movie \"The First Great Train Robbery.\" The dancer reenacted the scene where they broke into a guarded station office, impressing all the guests.\n\nDuring the party, George's friend Astro dressed up as Tony, the character played by John Travolta in \"Saturday Night Fever.\" He even showed off some of his disco moves on the dance floor.\n\nMeanwhile, Rosie the Robot shared a fun fact with the guests about the 1969 movie \"Play Dirty,\" in which Michael Caine appeared with his brother Stanley. The guests were fascinated by the trivia and enjoyed discussing other classic films.\n\nAs the evening progressed, the conversation took a darker turn when someone mentioned the tragic event that occurred in 1969 when a man was stabbed to death by a member of the Hell's Angels at a Rolling Stones concert. The concert was held at the Altamont Speedway in California, and the incident left a somber mark on the history of rock and roll.\n\nTo lighten the mood, Elroy shared a fun fact about space, explaining that it takes approximately 8 minutes and 20 seconds for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth. The guests marveled at the wonders of the universe and the advancements in technology that allowed them to live in their futuristic world.\n\nAs the party came to an end, the guests enjoyed a delicious meal that included anellini pasta, which was shaped like small rings.

She lived in a quaint village called Ambridge, where The Bull, a village pub, was the center of all social gatherings for the country folk.\n\nPrincess Bride was a curious soul, always eager to learn about the world and its history. One day, she stumbled upon a book about the famous King Henry VIII and became fascinated by the story of his second wife, Anne Boleyn. She admired Anne's strength and intelligence, and aspired to be as courageous as her.\n\nOne evening, while visiting The Bull, Princess Bride met a charming actor named Christian Slater, who was known for his role as the interviewer in the film 'Interview with a Vampire.' They bonded over their shared love for history and storytelling, and soon became inseparable.\n\nTogether, they decided to embark on a journey to the southernmost city in the United States, Key West, Florida. They were excited to explore the vibrant culture and beautiful landscapes of this unique city.\n\nAs they traveled, Princess Bride and Christian entertained each other with stories and quotes from their favorite plays and films. One of their favorites was the Shakespeare play, 'The Tempest,' which tells the story of Prospero, the rightful Duke of Milan.\n\nDuring their journey, they came across a magnificent aircraft, the RAF fighter-bomber built by the Panavia partnership. Inspired by its sleek design and powerful presence, they imagined themselves as daring pilots, soaring through the skies on thrilling adventures.\n\nAs they continued their travels, they often found themselves quoting catchphrases from their favorite television sitcom, 'Only Fools and Horses.' \"Rodney, you plonker!\" Princess Bride would exclaim, and Christian would reply, \"This time next year, we'll be millionaires!\" These playful exchanges brought them even closer together.\n\nOn the sixth day of their journey, Christian surprised Princess Bride with a gift to commemorate their adventure. Inspired by the song \"The Twelve Days of Christmas,\" he presented her with six geese a-laying, symbolizing the joy and creativity they had shared during their travels.\n\nAs they neared the end of their journey, they encountered a talented gymnast named Louis Smith, who had won an individual silver medal in the 2012 London Olympics for his incredible skills in the pommel horse discipline. Princess Bride and Christian were in awe of his talent and dedication, and they knew their journey had been enriched by meeting such inspiring individuals.\n\nAnd so, with hearts full of love and minds filled with unforgettable memories, Princess Bride and Christian Slater returned to their beloved village of Ambridge, forever grateful for the incredible adventure they had shared."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 7, "question_count": 10}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Captain Corelli's mandolin is a book a film set in which country", "The Bull is the village pub in an everyday tale of country folk.

Inspired by this, the Teletubbies decided to organize a friendly football match to entertain their guests.\n\nWhile searching for a suitable ball, they stumbled upon a family of chipmunks - Yellow-pine, Uinta, and Lodgepole.

They heard the word 'Charlie' representing the letter 'C' and waved excitedly at the pilot.\n\nThe pilot, a former RAF officer and author of the novel 'Airport', Arthur Hailey, decided to land and join the celebration.

The Teletubbies and their friends appreciated the valuable lesson.\n\nAs the sun began to set, the Teletubbies gathered everyone to share a moment of silence in memory of Boutros Ghali, the Prime Minister of Egypt who was assassinated in 1910. They wanted to honor his memory and remind everyone of the importance of peace and unity.\n\nWith the celebration coming to an end, the Teletubbies, chipmunks, Arthur Hailey, and Mr. Bean said their goodbyes, grateful for the new friendships and memories they had created.

The note then mentioned British Prime Minister Clement Attlee, who served between Winston Churchill's two terms in office.\n\nThe final question asked about the person who succeeded Alf Ramsey as England's caretaker football manager in 1974. As a football fan, Coco knew it was Joe Mercer. But what did all these questions have in common?\n\nCoco spent days trying to find a connection between the questions. She listened to \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" on repeat, hoping it would inspire her. As she pondered over the questions, she felt a growing sense of excitement and curiosity. Then, one day, as she was humming the tune, it suddenly clicked. Each answer had a connection to the number six!\n\n\"Now We Are Six\" was the title of the book, there were six colors of snooker balls, a Carpet referred to 3-to-1 odds which multiplied together equals six, \"Death in the Afternoon\" was Hemingway's sixth book, Gauguin painted six versions of \"Nevermore\" in Tahiti, Dr. No was the sixth James Bond novel, Clement Attlee was the sixth post-WWII Prime Minister, and Joe Mercer was the sixth England football manager.\n\nExcited by her discovery, Coco's heart raced as she realized the significance of the number six. She decided to share her findings with her friends, who were equally fascinated by the mysterious note and its connection to the number six. Together, they celebrated their shared love for music, art, literature, and sports, and the strange note that brought them even closer. As they discussed the connections, Coco felt a deep sense of satisfaction and camaraderie, knowing that the mysterious note had led her on a journey of discovery and friendship."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 9, "question_count": 10}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What is the title of Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s only UK number one hit single?", "Who wrote the book of verses \u2018Now We Are Six\u2019?", "Who played Beverley Hills hairdresser George Roundy in the 1975 film \u2018Shampoo\u2019?", "How many balls are on a snooker table at the beginning of a game?", "In betting, what odds are known as a \u2018Carpet\u2019?", "Bullfighting is central to which Ernest Hemingway non-fiction book?", "Which French painter lived and worked in Tahiti?", "What is the first name of James bond villain Dr No?", "Who was British Prime Minister between Winston Churchill\u2019s two terms in office?", "Who succeeded Alf Ramsey as England (caretaker) football manager in 1974?"], "answers": [["Bridge Over Troubled Waters", "Bridge over Troubled Waters", "A Bridge over Troubled Water", "Bridge over troubled water", "Song for the asking", "Bridge over Troubled Water", "Why Don't You Write Me", "Bridge Over Troubled Water", "Bridge Over Troubled Water (album)", "song for asking", "why don t you write me", "bridge over troubled water", "bridge over troubled water album", "bridge over troubled waters"], ["A a milne", "A.

They noticed that the number 5 lay between 12 and 20 on the standard dartboard and decided to give the game a try. To their surprise, they were both quite good at it and soon became regulars at the pub's weekly dart tournaments.\n\nJessica's love for adventure and exploration continued to grow, and she became fascinated by the idea of time travel. In 1990, she went to see the film \"Back to the Future Part III,\" in which Michael J. Fox travels back to the year 1885 in the Wild West. This movie inspired her to learn more about the history of her town and the world.\n\nThrough her many adventures and experiences, Jessica and her beloved skunk Sing became well-rounded individuals who were passionate about learning and making a difference in their community. They continued to explore the world together, always seeking new knowledge and experiences, and inspiring those around them to do the same."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 7, "question_count": 10}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In June 1978, who became the first cricketer to score a century and take eight wickets in one inning in a Test Match?", "What is a female skunk called?", "The name Jessica was invented by William Shakespeare for which of his plays?", "In the Bible, how many psalms make up the Book of Psalms?", "Brenda Ann Spencer\u2019s justification for opening fire at a San Diego school on January 29th 1979 inspired which song by The Boomtown Rats?", "In 1610, who became the first person to observe Saturn\u2019s rings through a telescope?", "What was the only film directed by Cecil B DeMille in which actor John Wayne appeared?", "On a standard dartboard, which number lies between 12 and 20?", "In which year did students first enrol in the Open University in the UK", "Michael J Fox travels back to which year in the Wild West in the 1990 film \u2018Back To The Future Part III\u2019?"], "answers": [["Sir Ian Terence Botham", "Ian Botham", "Ian Terence Botham", "I T Botham", "Sir Ian Botham", "ian botham", "sir ian botham", "ian terence botham", "i t botham", "sir ian terence botham"], ["Sows", "SOW (disambiguation)", "Sow (disambiguation)", "Sow", "SOW", "sows", "sow disambiguation", "sow"], ["TMOV", "Prince of Arragon", "A Merchant of Venice", "Gratiano", "The Merchant Of Venice", "El Mercader de Venecia", "Bassanio", "Lancelot Gobbo", "Lorenzo (Merchant of Venice)", "The Merchant of Venice", "Old Gobbo", "Nerissa (Merchant of Venice)", "The comicall Historie of the Merchant of Venice", "The Jew of Venice", "Jessica (Merchant of Venice)", "Merchant of venice", "The most excellent Historie of the Merchant of Venice", "Merchant of Venice", "The mo\u017ft excellent Hi\u017ftorie of the Merchant of Venice", "Tubal (character)", "The merchant of vencie", "Merchant Of Venice", "merchant of vencie", "comicall historie of merchant of venice", "lorenzo merchant of venice", "gratiano", "el mercader de venecia", "tmov", "jew of venice", "old gobbo", "most excellent historie of merchant of venice", "nerissa merchant of venice", "prince of arragon", "bassanio", "jessica merchant of venice", "lancelot gobbo", "tubal character", "merchant of venice", "mo\u017ft excellent hi\u017ftorie of merchant of venice"], ["150", "one hundred and fifty", "150", "one hundred and fifty"], ["I hate Mondays", "I Don't Like Mondays (Song)", "I dont like mondays", "I hate mondays", "I don't like mondays", "I Don\u2019t Like Mondays", "I Don't Like Mondays (song)", "I don't like Mondays", "I Don't Like Mondays", "i hate mondays", "i dont like mondays", "i don t like mondays", "i don t like mondays song"], ["Galaleo", "Light of nature", "Galileo's finger", "Father of modern observational astronomy", "Gailieo Galilei", "Galileo", "Galeleo", "Galileo Galiei", "Galilei Galileo", "Il lume naturale", "Natural light of reason", "Gallaleo", "Galilao", "A Very Brief Summary of the Life of Galileo", "Galileo galilei", "G.

The information provided is accurate, and the story flows well, considering the diverse nature of the questions. The characters are well-integrated into the narrative, and their connections to the original questions are clear.\n\nOne area that could be improved is the pacing of the story. The introduction of characters and their connections to the questions is quite rapid, which might make it difficult for readers to fully engage with the story. Slowing down the pace and providing more context or background for each character could help improve the overall coherence of the story.\n\nAdditionally, the story could benefit from a more developed plot or conflict. While the characters form an alliance and navigate the dangerous world of the Ice Age, there isn't a clear central conflict or goal for the characters to work towards. Introducing a more defined challenge or objective for the group could help make the story more engaging and satisfying for readers.\n\nOverall, the response does an excellent job of weaving the answers to the 10 questions into a creative and coherent story. With some adjustments to pacing and plot development, the story could be even more engaging and enjoyable for readers.\n---\nBased on your initial response and the subsequent feedback, revise the response.

He saw a shirt with the number 10 on it, which reminded him of England rugby union player Jonny Wilkinson, who wore the same number in the 2011 World Cup. Wall-E decided to buy the shirt as a souvenir of his time in this strange land.\n\nDuring his time in Leeds, Wall-E couldn't help but notice the litter scattered throughout the city. He decided to put his waste-collecting skills to good use and began cleaning up the streets, earning the admiration and gratitude of the locals.\n\nOne evening, Wall-E noticed a beautiful full moon in the sky. He learned that it was called a 'Beaver Moon,' which occurs during the month of November. Wall-E found the name amusing and decided to celebrate the occasion by trying some local lager. He chose a brand called Carlsberg, which had the advertising slogan, 'Probably the best lager in the world.'\n\nAs Wall-E enjoyed his lager, he met a wise old man named Mr. Worldly Wisemen, a character from the 17th-century book 'The Pilgrim's Progress.' Mr. Worldly Wisemen told Wall-E about the Mahlabatari Declaration of Faith, a statement of core principles laid down by the political leaders of Botswana in 1974. Wall-E was fascinated by the history and culture of this faraway land.\n\nOne day, as Wall-E was admiring the giallo, or yellow, autumn leaves in a park, he realized that it was time for him to return to his own time and place. With a heavy heart, he said goodbye to his new friends and, with the help of Gary Sparrow's time-traveling device, returned to his own world.\n\nBack in his own time, Wall-E cherished the memories of his adventures in Leeds. He often wore his Jonny Wilkinson rugby shirt and listened to Roxy Music while sipping on Carlsberg lager, reminiscing about the friends he had made and the lessons he had learned during his time in that strange and wonderful land. He also took pride in the positive impact he had made on the city by using his waste-collecting skills to help clean up the streets of Leeds."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos":

Finlay was a unique bug who loved adventure and exploring new places. Every year, he eagerly awaited the World Bog Snorkelling Championships held in his homeland. He loved watching the humans compete in this bizarre event, and it always brought excitement to his otherwise mundane bug life.\n\nOne day, Finlay met a wise old bug named Malcolm, who told him stories of the vast universe beyond their tiny world. Malcolm spoke of a planet called Mars, where the largest known volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, towered over the landscape. Finlay was fascinated by these tales and dreamed of exploring the universe himself.\n\nInspired by the Scottish physician and novelist A.J.

Inspired by the novel, Aladdin used his quick thinking and resourcefulness to calm the man down and stop the nosebleed.\n\nNews of Aladdin's heroic act spread quickly throughout the city, eventually reaching the ears of Queen Philippa of Hainault, the wife of King Edward III. Impressed by Aladdin's bravery and kindness, the royal couple invited him to their palace to thank him personally.\n\nUpon arriving at the palace, Aladdin was awestruck by its grandeur, which reminded him of the towering Chicago building that became the tallest in the world in 1973. He felt a sense of pride and accomplishment as he entered the royal court.\n\nAs Aladdin spoke with the king and queen, they shared stories of their own adventures, including the tale of the infamous robbery masterminded by the late English criminal Bruce Reynolds. The robbery, which Reynolds referred to as his \"Sistine Chapel ceiling,\" was a testament to the cunning and audacity of the human spirit.\n\nInspired by the stories of the Mallard, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bruce Reynolds, Aladdin vowed to continue his own adventures and pursue greatness in his own unique way. With the support of the royal couple and the people of Agrabah, Aladdin embarked on a new journey, filled with excitement, wonder, and the promise of a bright future."], "parsing_success_flag":

Belle loved to learn about the world and its history, and her favorite book was a collection of stories about famous people and events.\n\nOne day, Belle came across a captivating story about rower Alex Partridge and hockey player Hannah Macleod, who had their Olympic medals stolen from a nightclub in October 2012. She couldn't help but wonder what kind of person would commit such a crime and how the athletes must have felt.\n\nAs she continued reading, she discovered a whimsical story about Rolf Harris, who recorded a 1964 single calling for Ringo Starr, a member of The Beatles, to be president. Belle found this amusing and couldn't help but hum the tune as she read on, imagining a world with a musician as its leader.\n\nNext, she stumbled upon a fascinating mystery about the English peer and courtier, Edward de Vere, who had been proposed as the most popular candidate for the authorship of Shakespeare's works. Belle was intrigued by the enigma and spent hours researching the topic, feeling a sense of connection with the literary world.\n\nOne day, while playing a game of Scrabble with her father, Belle realized there were twelve 'E' tiles provided in the game. She found this fact fascinating and decided to incorporate it into a story she was writing, adding a touch of realism to her fictional world.\n\nAs she continued her research, Belle discovered a story about the 1993 film 'Addams Family Values,' in which Raul Julia played Gomez Addams. She loved the movie for its eccentric characters and decided to watch it again that evening, appreciating the actor's portrayal of Gomez.\n\nBelle's curiosity led her to a story about 'Black Wednesday,' which referred to September 16, 1992, when the British government was forced to withdraw the pound sterling from the European Rate Mechanism. She was amazed by the impact this event had on politics and economics and felt a deeper understanding of the complexities of the world.\n\nIn another story, Belle learned that in June 1991, the late US President Zachary Taylor was exhumed to test whether his death was caused by arsenic poisoning and not gastrointestinal illness. The mystery surrounding his death captivated her, and she felt a sense of empathy for the president's family.\n\nBelle's love for art led her to a story about Leonardo da Vinci's painting, 'The Last Supper,' which was placed back on display in Milan in May 1999 after over 20 years of restoration work. She longed to see the masterpiece in person someday, imagining the awe she would feel in its presence.\n\nOne day, Belle stumbled upon a story about 'David and Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web,' which was renamed 'Yahoo!' in March 1994. She marveled at how much the internet had grown since then and felt grateful for the wealth of knowledge it provided.\n\nAs Belle continued to read and learn, she caught the attention of a mysterious Beast who lived in a nearby castle. He was captivated by her beauty and intelligence and decided to invite her to his castle to share his vast library with her.\n\nBelle and the Beast spent hours discussing the stories they had read, and their shared love for knowledge brought them closer together. Over time, they fell in love, and the Beast's curse was lifted, transforming him back into a handsome prince.\n\nTogether, Belle and the prince continued to explore the world through books and shared their love for learning with their kingdom. Their passion for knowledge inspired others, and the kingdom flourished. And they lived happily ever after."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Rower Alex Partridge and hockey player Hannah Macleod had what stolen from a nightclub in October 2012?", "Rolf Harris recorded a 1964 single calling for which member of The Beatles \u2018For President\u2019?", "Which English peer and courtier has been the most popular candidate proposed for the authorship of Shakespeare\u2019s works?", "How many \u2018E\u2019 tiles are provided in a Scrabble game?", "Who played Gomez Addams in the 1993 film \u2018Addams Family Values\u2019?", "In politics and economics, \u2018what\u2019 Wednesday refers to 16th September 1992, when the British government was forced to withdraw the pound sterling from the European Rate Mechanism, after they were unable to keep it above its agreed lower limit?", "In June 1991, which late US President was exhumed to test whether his death was caused by arsenic poisoning and not gastrointestinal illness?", "In May 1999, after over 20 years of restoration work, which painting by Leonardo da Vinci was placed back on display in Milan?", "In March 1994, what was \u2018David and Jerry\u2019s Guide to the World Wide Web\u2019 renamed?", "Ray\u2019s Jazz Cafe is situated inside which famous London bookshop?"], "answers": [["Olympic Bronze Medals", "olympic bronze medals"], ["RINGO", "Starr, Ringo", "Richard Starkey, Jr.", "Beatle Ringo", "Ringo Star", "Richie Snare", "Ringo starkey", "Ringo Starr", "Ringo Starkey", "Ringo", "Richard Starkey", "%22Ringo%22", "Richard Starky", "Richard Starrkey", "Ringo (film)", "Richard Starkey Jr.", "Ringo starr", "Richard Henry Parkin Starkey Jr.", "richard henry parkin starkey jr", "richard starrkey", "richie snare", "richard starkey jr", "ringo star", "22ringo 22", "ringo starkey", "starr ringo", "richard starkey", "ringo", "ringo film", "ringo starr", "beatle ringo", "richard starky"], ["De Vere, Edward, 17th Earl of Oxford", "Edward de vere", "Edward devere", "Edward de Vere 17th Earl of Oxford", "17th Earl of Oxford", "Edward Oxenford", "17th Earl of Oxford, Lord Bulbeck", "Oxford, Edward de Vere, 17th earl of", "Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford", "Edward Vere, Earl of Oxford", "Edward de Vere", "edward de vere", "de vere edward 17th earl of oxford", "17th earl of oxford lord bulbeck", "edward de vere 17th earl of oxford", "edward vere earl of oxford", "edward oxenford", "edward devere", "17th earl of oxford", "oxford edward de vere 17th earl of"], ["twelve", "12", "twelve", "12"], ["Raul Julia y Arcelay", "Raul y Arcelay", "Ra\u00fal Julia", "Raul R.

Queen Joan was the stepmother of King Henry IV, an English monarch.\n\nQueen Joan told Mulan about the Grizzled Giant, Southern Flying, and Provost's squirrels that lived in the nearby forest. These creatures were known for their agility and resourcefulness, and they could help Mulan navigate the treacherous path to the louvar's lair. With the squirrels' assistance, Mulan finally reached the louvar and asked for its guidance.\n\nThe louvar agreed to help Mulan, but first, she had to answer a riddle. The riddle was about a British Prime Minister who took office in October 1922. Mulan, being well-versed in history, knew the answer was Andrew Bonar Law. Impressed by her knowledge, the louvar revealed the secret to solving the Rubik's Cube.\n\nAs Mulan continued her journey, she came across a Disney film playing in a small village. The film was 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks,' and it featured characters such as Emelius Browne, Mr. Jelk, and Colonel Heller. Mulan was inspired by the film's message of courage and determination, and she pressed on with renewed vigor.\n\nAs Mulan approached Azal's lair, she noticed a firework display in the sky. One of the fireworks was named after an instrument of torture on which a saint was said to have been martyred. This firework was called the Catherine Wheel, and it served as a reminder of the suffering that Azal had caused.\n\nWith the louvar's guidance and the squirrels' help, Mulan finally solved the Rubik's Cube. The cube's power was unleashed, and Azal and Jask were banished back to their own world. As the magic took effect, Mulan realized that the square root of 144 was 12, which symbolized the unity of her family and the twelve provinces of China.\n\nMulan returned home as a hero, and her story was passed down through generations as a testament to her bravery, intelligence, and love for her family and country.\n---\nFeedback: The response is creative and does a good job of incorporating the answers to the 10 questions into a coherent story about Mulan. The information provided is mostly accurate, with the exception of the number of squares on each side of a Rubik's Cube, which should be 9 instead of 6. The story flows well and maintains a consistent narrative throughout.\n\nTo improve the response, the writer could correct the number of squares on each side of the Rubik's Cube and perhaps provide a more seamless integration of the various elements from the questions. For example, the mention of the Disney film 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' could be woven into the story more naturally, rather than simply stating that Mulan came across it playing in a village. Additionally, the writer could explore the significance of the number 12 in relation to the square root of 144 and the unity of Mulan's family and the twelve provinces of China, as this connection seems a bit arbitrary.\n\nOverall, the response is imaginative and engaging, and with a few minor adjustments, it could be an even more compelling story.\n---\nBased on your initial response and the subsequent feedback, revise the response.

Azal had a gargoyle servant named Jask, who was known for his cunning and cruelty. Jask was a character from the BBC science fiction series Doctor Who, and he had somehow found his way into Mulan's world.\n\nMulan knew that in order to defeat Azal, she needed to solve a magical Rubik's Cube that had six squares on each side. This cube was said to hold the power to banish Azal and Jask back to their own world. As Mulan embarked on her journey, she came across a family who offered her shelter and food. This family's surname was Brockman, and they were known for their humor and wit, just like the family in the BBC comedy series 'Outnumbered.'\n\nDuring her stay with the Brockmans, Mulan learned about a mythical creature called a louvar. This fish-like creature was said to possess great wisdom and could help her solve the Rubik's Cube. Mulan set out to find the louvar, and along the way, she encountered Queen Joan of Navarre, who had been imprisoned for witchcraft.

Saffron Monsoon and a few others found themselves discussing Capnolagia, the arousal from watching others smoke, while another group debated the complexities of Othello Syndrome, a type of delusional jealousy of infidelity of a spouse or partner named after a Shakespearian character.\n\nTo lighten the mood, Tarzan's animal friends performed a musical tribute to the late singer Michael Jackson, featuring his first solo UK number one hit single, \"One Day in Your Life.\" The performance was so well-received that the guests decided to build a new London Underground rail line in Tarzan's jungle, which they nicknamed the 'Twopenny Tube' for its flat fare.\n\nAnd so, the grand celebration in the heart of the jungle came to an end, leaving Tarzan and his new friends with memories that would last a lifetime."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 6, "question_count": 10}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Who played Saffron Monsoon in the UK television comedy series \u2018Absolutely Fabulous\u2019?", "What is the title of William Shakespeare\u2019s shortest play?", "Rapunzel, Mother Gothel and Paulo are all characters in which 2010 animated film?", "Which, then fictional, award is mentioned in the opening scene of the 1950 film \u2018All About Eve\u2019, starring Bette Davis?", "Artiodactyla Suidae is the scientific name for which farm animal?", "Which UK television chef made Earl Grey and mandarin hot cross buns for Waitrose?", "Capnolagia is the arousal from watching others do what?", "Which syndrome, a type of delusional jealousy of infidelity of a spouse or partner, is named after a Shakespearian character?", "What was late singer Michael Jackson\u2019s first solo UK number one hit single?", "Which London Underground rail line was nicknamed the \u2018Twopenny Tube\u2019 for its flat fare?"], "answers": [["Julie Sawala", "Julia Sawala", "Julia Sawalha", "julia sawala", "julia sawalha", "julie sawala"], ["The Comedie of Errors", "The Comedy of Errors", "The Comedy Of Errors", "Angelo (The Comedy of Errors)", "Aegeon", "A Comedy of Errors", "Comedy of Errors", "Comedy Of Errors", "Dromio", "Comedy of Errors (play)", "The Comedie of Errors.", "comedy of errors", "dromio", "comedy of errors play", "comedie of errors", "angelo comedy of errors", "aegeon"], ["Rapunzel (2010 film)", "Rapunzel Unbraided", "Healing Incantation", "Gothel (Disney)", "Disney's Rapunzel", "Tangled Characters", "Tangled (movie)", "List of Tangled characters", "Princess Rapunzel", "Tangled", "List of Characters in Disney's Tangled", "Rapunzel (film)", "Rapunzel: A Tangled Tale", "Tangled (soundtrack)", "Rapunzel (2009 film)", "Tangled (2010 film)", "List of characters in Disney's Tangled", "disney s rapunzel", "list of characters in disney s tangled", "tangled soundtrack", "rapunzel film", "rapunzel unbraided", "tangled characters", "rapunzel tangled tale", "rapunzel 2010 film", "gothel disney", "healing incantation", "tangled movie", "list of tangled characters", "princess rapunzel", "tangled 2010 film", "tangled", "rapunzel 2009 film"], ["Sarah Siddons Society", "The Sarah Siddons Award", "Sarah Siddons Award", "sarah siddons society", "sarah siddons award"], ["Chazer", "Piggeh", "Sus (genus)", "Pig", "Pigs", "\ud83d\udc37", "\ud83d\udc16", "\ud83d\udc3d", "\ud83d\udc3d", "sus genus", "piggeh", "pigs", "\ud83d\udc37", "\ud83d\udc16", "chazer", "pig"], ["The Big Fat Duck Cookbook", "Heston Blumenthal", "Heston blumental", "big fat duck cookbook", "heston blumenthal", "heston blumental"], ["Wood smoke", "Smoke", "wood smoke", "smoke"], ["Othello syndrome", "Othello Syndrome", "Morbid jealousy", "Delusional jealousy", "morbid jealousy", "delusional jealousy", "othello syndrome"], ["One Day in Your Life", "One Day in Your Life (disambiguation)", "One Day in Your Life (song)", "One Day In Your Life", "One Day In Your Life (song)", "one day in your life", "one day in your life song", "one day in your life disambiguation"], ["Richmond extensions of the Central Line", "Central line", "Richmond extensions", "Central line depots", "Central Line", "richmond extensions of central line", "central line depots", "central line", "richmond extensions"]], "question_ids": ["qb_7965", "qb_7975", "qb_8014", "qb_8024", "qb_8036", "qb_8043", "qb_8050", "qb_8058", "qb_8101", "qb_8115"], "topic": "Tarzan"}}

The information provided is accurate, and the story flows well, connecting the various elements in a creative and engaging manner. The story maintains a sense of wonder and adventure, while also introducing historical and cultural references.\n\nOne area that could be improved is the transition between the introduction of the sterlet, Mildred, and the discussion of the world's first teletext information service. The connection between these two topics could be made more explicit, perhaps by having Mildred explain how she came to learn about the teletext service.\n\nOverall, the response is well-written and effectively weaves the answers to the questions into an enjoyable story about Bambi's adventures.\n---\nBased on your initial response and the subsequent feedback, revise the response.
