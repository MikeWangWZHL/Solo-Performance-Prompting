Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1.

He stumbled upon a rare vinyl of Blondie's \"The Tide is High,\" their last UK No 1 of the 80s. Intrigued by the music, Bilbo decided to learn more about the world outside the Shire.\n\nHe visited the local library and found a book about famous people from the past. He read about Anne Bancroft, a talented actress born in the 1930s, and Cindy Crawford, a supermodel who named her first son after a rock star. Bilbo was fascinated by the stories of these remarkable individuals.\n\nOne day, Bilbo attended a grand party in the Shire. He noticed a beautiful dress worn by one of the guests and learned that it was designed by Catherine Walker, the same designer who created the dress that made the most at Diana's dress auction.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake.

They had heard tales of a mysterious golf course in Antarctica where players used orange golf balls. Intrigued by this strange game, they decided to embark on a journey to learn more about it.\n\nAs they traveled, they discovered a hidden village where the animals loved music. The village was filled with the sounds of Phil Collins, whose songs were recorded on the Virgin Records label throughout the 80s and 90s. The animals danced and sang along, and Mowgli, Baloo, and Bagheera couldn't help but join in the fun.\n\nOne day, they met an old wise elephant who told them stories of the legendary musician Chuck Berry, who recorded on the Chess Records label in the 1950s and 1960s. The elephant shared tales of how Chuck Berry's music had inspired generations of animals in the jungle.\n\nDuring their journey, they also encountered a group of monkeys who were fascinated by human culture. The monkeys eagerly shared gossip about famous humans, such as Michael Jackson and his second wife, Debbie Rowe. Mowgli, Baloo, and Bagheera listened with curiosity, learning more about the world outside the jungle.\n\nFinally, they reached the edge of the jungle and discovered a beautiful city named Pittsburgh, which was named after the British Prime Minister, William Pitt the Elder. The city was a perfect blend of nature and human civilization, and the friends marveled at the sight.\n\nAs they explored Pittsburgh, they realized that their journey had brought them closer together and taught them the value of friendship and the power of music.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints!

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12.

Five-legged creatures, known as Starfish, were causing havoc in their underwater paradise, the Great Barrier Reef. The 1250-mile long wonder was in danger, and the Emoji friends knew they had to act fast.\n\nGene, the ever-adaptable Emoji, took the lead and gathered his friends, including the knowledgeable Poop Emoji, who shared some vital information. \"Did you know that progesterone, a hormone, helps control ovulation in living beings? And that oxygen is the second most common gas in the atmosphere?\" Poop Emoji said, hoping these facts would somehow help them in their quest.\n\nAs they ventured deeper into the ocean, they discovered that the root of the problem was eutrophication, the nutrient enrichment of lakes. This process was causing an imbalance in the underwater ecosystem, allowing the Starfish to thrive and damage the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nDetermined to save their world, the Emoji friends devised a plan to restore balance to the ecosystem. They knew that the Earth's circumference was approximately 24,901 miles, and they had to cover a vast distance to find a solution.\n\nAfter a long and arduous journey, the Emoji friends managed to reverse the eutrophication process and save the Great Barrier Reef.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12.

Here's a draft:\n\nIn the magical world of Fairly OddParents, Timmy Turner was feeling bored one day. He decided to use his fairy godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, to travel back in time to the year 1988. Upon arriving, he found himself in a bustling arcade where he saw a game called \"Pac-Man\" featuring ghosts named Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Clyde. Timmy was fascinated by the game and spent hours playing it.\n\nAs he left the arcade, he stumbled upon a music store where he heard a catchy song called \"Valentine\" by T'Pau playing on the radio. He couldn't help but dance to the rhythm of the song.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12.

As they ventured deeper into the woods, they stumbled upon a hidden grove filled with delicious grapes. Eliza, the youngest Thornberry, excitedly picked some and shared them with her family.\n\nAs they enjoyed the grapes, they overheard a group of Scottish football fans discussing their favorite teams. They learned that there were three teams with names ending in 'United'. The Thornberrys, being curious, decided to attend a match and experience the excitement of Scottish football.\n\nLater that evening, they gathered around a campfire and listened to some classic tunes. They were particularly captivated by Sam Cooke's 'Cupid', a top ten hit from 1961. As the night went on, they reminisced about their favorite TV shows, and Eliza mentioned 'Only Fools and Horses', which had a catchy theme tune that started with 'Stick a pony in me pocket'.\n\nThe Wild Thornberrys continued their adventure, cherishing the memories they made and the new experiences they shared."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "spp_profile", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What seven letter word, beginning with the letters 'Ra' is a palindrome?", "Which fruit can go in the middle of the word aped to make a new word?", "How many scottish football league teams names end in United?", "Who had a top ten hit in the UK with Cupid in 1961?", "The theme tune to which TV show starts with the line Stick a pony in me pocket?"], "answers": [["Racing cars", "Automobile Racing", "Automotive racing", "Car racing", "Race driver", "Racecars", "Automobile racer", "Autorace", "Car race", "Autosports", "Racecar", "Race cars", "Automobile race", "\ud83c\udfce", "Racing driver", "AutoRacing", "Racing Car", "Auto racing", "Auto Racing", "Auto race", "Race-car", "Race Cars", "Auto Race", "Race car", "Racing car", "Race car driver", "Automobile racing", "Racecar driver", "race driver", "autorace", "automobile racing", "automobile race", "race car driver", "autosports", "racecar driver", "autoracing", "auto racing", "racecars", "race cars", "racing car", "automobile racer", "auto race", "car racing", "racing driver", "\ud83c\udfce", "car race", "race car", "racing cars", "racecar", "automotive racing"], ["Pear (fruit)", "Pear tree", "Pear", "Culture of pear", "\ud83c\udf50", "Pear juice", "Pearwood", "Pyrus", "\ud83c\udf50", "culture of pear", "pyrus", "pearwood", "pear tree", "pear juice", "pear", "pear fruit"], ["3", "three", "three", "3"], ["I Thank God", "Sam Cooke", "Bertha Franklin", "Dale Cook (singer)", "bertha franklin", "i thank god", "dale cook singer", "sam cooke"], ["Sunglasses Ron", "Lovely jubly", "Only Fools and Horses", "Voted Britain's Best Sitcom", "Only Fools and Horses...", "Only Fools", "Yernly Fyerls and Nesbits", "Only Fools & Horses", "Trotters International Traders Plc", "Once upon a time in peckham", "OF&H", "Nelson Mandella House", "Paddy The Greek", "Only Fools And Horses", "Trotters Independent Traders", "Only fools and horses", "George Trotter", "Peckham Echo", "only fools and horses", "paddy greek", "of h", "george trotter", "peckham echo", "sunglasses ron", "yernly fyerls and nesbits", "only fools horses", "only fools", "trotters international traders plc", "lovely jubly", "voted britain s best sitcom", "once upon time in peckham", "trotters independent traders", "nelson mandella house"]], "question_ids": ["qz_866", "qz_871", "qz_881", "qz_921", "qz_941"], "topic": "Wild Thornberrys"}}

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

The Elephants were known for their slow and steady playing style, which often led them to victory.\n\nAs the match began, The Waves quickly took the lead, scoring goal after goal. The Elephants struggled to keep up, and the final score was a staggering 31-0 in favor of The Waves. Despite their impressive victory, The Waves still failed to qualify for the championship due to a technicality.\n\nDisappointed but not defeated, the team gathered at their favorite hangout spot, Roland's Rat Caf\u00e9, to drown their sorrows in milkshakes. Roland, the caf\u00e9's owner, was a quirky character who had a pet gerbil named Kevin. He always cheered up the team with his eccentric humor and stories about his adventures with Kevin.\n\nAs the friends laughed and reminisced about their journey, they realized that their love for soccer and their friendship was more important than any championship.

Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, the resident scientist, proudly answered, \"Einstein won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the photoelectric effect!\"\n\nAs the game progressed, the Muppets faced a question about astronomy. \"Which planet has moons named after Shakespearean characters?\" Miss Piggy inquired. Gonzo, who had always been fascinated by outer space, excitedly replied, \"Uranus!\"\n\nFinally, during the last challenge, the Muppets were asked a question about their own history. \"Who dubbed Miss Piggy's singing voice in The Muppet Movie?\" Kermit asked with a smile. Miss Piggy blushed and answered, \"It was the talented Frank Oz!\"\n\nThe Muppets successfully completed all the challenges in \"Muppet Boyard\" and celebrated their victory together.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first.

Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Here's my initial draft of the story:\n\nSing, a young adventurer, had always been fascinated by the tales of the mysterious artifact hidden in the Sulu Archipelago. One day, while exploring an old library, Sing stumbled upon a dusty book that contained a map to the artifact's location. As Sing traced the map with his finger, the spirit of Spencer Perceval, the only Prime Minister of Britain to be assassinated, appeared before him.\n\nSpencer revealed that he had been guarding the secret of the artifact for centuries and chose Sing to be the one to find it. He explained that the artifact was once owned by the legendary magician Ivan Owen, who first introduced the world to Basil Brush. The artifact was said to hold immense power, and it was up to Sing to ensure it didn't fall into the wrong hands.\n\nWith Spencer's guidance, Sing embarked on a thrilling journey to the Sulu Archipelago.

A group of villains planned to raise the sunken ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, and use it as a weapon to wreak havoc on the world. Sing, Spencer, and Felix knew they had to stop the villains and secure the artifact before it was too late.\n\nIn a climactic battle, Sing and his companions fought the villains and managed to retrieve the artifact. With the power of the artifact in their hands, they ensured the Herald of Free Enterprise remained at the bottom of the sea, never to be used for evil again.

What was the name of the ferry that capsized after leaving Zeebrugge in 1987\n"}], "unwrapped_output": ["Sing, a young adventurer with a curious spirit, had always been fascinated by the tales of the mysterious artifact hidden in the Sulu Archipelago, a chain of islands in the southwestern Philippines. One day, while exploring an old library filled with ancient tomes and forgotten knowledge, Sing stumbled upon a dusty book that contained a map to the artifact's location. As Sing traced the map with his finger, the spirit of Spencer Perceval, the only Prime Minister of Britain to be assassinated, appeared before him, dressed in the attire of the early 19th century.\n\nSpencer revealed that he had been guarding the secret of the artifact for centuries and chose Sing to be the one to find it. He explained that the artifact was once owned by the legendary magician Ivan Owen, who first introduced the world to the mischievous fox puppet, Basil Brush. The artifact was said to hold immense power, capable of bending reality itself, and it was up to Sing to ensure it didn't fall into the wrong hands.\n\nWith Spencer's guidance, Sing embarked on a thrilling journey to the Sulu Archipelago, navigating through lush jungles and crystal-clear waters. Along the way, they encountered various challenges and met interesting characters, including Felix Leiter, a retired secret agent who had been played by numerous actors over the years, such as Jack Lord, Cec Linder, Rik Van Nutter, Norman Burton, David Hedison, John Terry, and Jeffrey Wright. Felix decided to join Sing and Spencer on their quest, providing valuable skills and knowledge from his years of espionage.\n\nAs the trio neared the artifact's location, hidden within a mysterious cave, they learned of a sinister plot to use the artifact's power for evil. A group of villains, led by a ruthless mastermind, planned to raise the sunken ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, which had capsized after leaving Zeebrugge in 1987, and use it as a weapon to wreak havoc on the world. Sing, Spencer, and Felix knew they had to stop the villains and secure the artifact before it was too late.\n\nIn a climactic battle, Sing and his companions fought the villains in the heart of the cave, using their wits and courage to outsmart their foes. They managed to retrieve the artifact, a small, intricately carved stone that glowed with an otherworldly light. With the power of the artifact in their hands, they ensured the Herald of Free Enterprise remained at the bottom of the sea, never to be used for evil again. Sing returned the artifact to its rightful place in the Sulu Archipelago, knowing that he had fulfilled his destiny and protected the world from a terrible fate."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "spp_profile", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which character has been played by Jack Lord, Cec Linder, Rik Van Nutter, Norman Burton, David Hedison, John Terry, David Hedison and Jeffrey Wright?", "Name the magician who first introduced us to Basil Brush.", "Who was the only Prime Minister of Britain to be assassinated?", "What is the name of the chain of islands in the southwestern Philippines?", "What was the name of the ferry that capsized after leaving Zeebrugge in 1987"], "answers": [["A) Felix Leiter", "Clarence Leiter", "Cedar Leiter", "Felix Leiter", "Felix Lieter", "clarence leiter", "felix lieter", "cedar leiter", "felix leiter"], ["David Nixon (disambiguation)", "David Nixon", "Nixon, David", "nixon david", "david nixon disambiguation", "david nixon"], ["Spencer perceval", "Spencer Perceval KC", "Spencer Perceval, KC", "Spencer Perceval", "Spencer Percival", "spencer perceval kc", "spencer perceval", "spencer percival"], ["Sulu (island)", "Sulu Islands", "Sulu archipelago", "Sulu Archipelago", "The Sulu Archipelago", "Sulu Island", "sulu island", "sulu archipelago", "sulu islands"], ["M/S Herald of Free Enterprise", "Zeebrugge ferry disaster", "MS Herald of Free Enterprise", "Herald of free enterprise", "IMO 7820485", "Flushing Range", "The Herald of Free Enterprise", "Herald of Free Enterprise", "The Herald of free Enterprise", "Zeebrugge Disaster", "herald of free enterprise", "flushing range", "zeebrugge ferry disaster", "imo 7820485", "ms herald of free enterprise", "m s herald of free enterprise", "zeebrugge disaster"]], "question_ids": ["qz_4121", "qz_4127", "qz_4140", "qz_4147", "qz_4151"], "topic": "Sing"}}

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words.

We can start by setting the scene in the Ice Age and introducing a main character who is on a quest to find the Holy Grail.\n\nIce Age Expert: During the Ice Age, large parts of the Earth were covered in ice and snow. The main character could be a creature that is well-adapted to the cold environment, such as a woolly mammoth or a saber-toothed tiger.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the story:\n\nIn the heart of the Ice Age, a brave woolly mammoth named Firenze embarked on a quest to find the legendary Holy Grail. Firenze, named after the wise centaur from the Harry Potter series, was known for his intelligence and courage. He believed that the Holy Grail held the power to end the Ice Age and bring warmth back to the world.\n\nAs Firenze journeyed through the frozen lands, he encountered a group of creatures who were also on a quest to find the Holy Grail. Among them was a saber-toothed tiger named Hazell, inspired by the cockney private detective portrayed by Nicholas Ball. Hazell was a skilled tracker and had a keen sense of direction.\n\nTogether, they followed clues that led them to the mysterious Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland, which was said to house the Holy Grail. The chapel was a magnificent structure, even in the Ice Age, and it reminded Firenze of the building featured prominently at the end of The Da Vinci Code.\n\nAs they approached the chapel, they were greeted by a pair of comical creatures named Bubble and Penelope. Bubble, named after the character played by Jane Horrocks in Absolutely Fabulous, was a clumsy but lovable sloth. Penelope, named after the actress Penelope Wilton who played the wife of Richard Briers in the sitcom \"Ever Decreasing Circles\", was a wise and nurturing mammoth.\n\nTogether, the group entered the chapel and discovered the Holy Grail. With its power, they brought an end to the Ice Age and ushered in a new era of warmth and prosperity for all creatures.\n\nStory Writer: The story is engaging and incorporates all the trivia answers. It also has a coherent plot and a satisfying conclusion. Good job!\nTrivia Expert: All the trivia answers are included in the story. Well done!\nIce Age Expert: The story captures the essence of the Ice Age and includes appropriate creatures for the setting.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct.

That year, Alderman Sir Cuthbert Ackroyd, who later became Lord Mayor of London, bought the first Premium Bond on 1 November 1956, marking a new era of prosperity for the kingdom.\n\nIn this land, the people traveled in unique vehicles called Bond Bugs, small two-seat, three-wheeled sports cars produced between 1970 and 1974. These colorful and quirky cars zipped through the streets, bringing joy and excitement to the citizens of Tangled.\n\nOne day, a famous explorer named Jacques Cousteau arrived in Tangled with his mobile oceanographic laboratory, Calypso. He shared his knowledge of the ocean and its creatures with the people, inspiring them to protect and cherish their marine environment.\n\nThe President of Tangled, who was often seen flying in a helicopter called Marine One, decided to host a grand ball at the historic Hever Castle in Kent. This castle was once the home of Queen Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII, and her spirit was said to still roam the halls.\n\nAs the people of Tangled gathered at Hever Castle, they celebrated their history, their unique vehicles, and their connection to the ocean. They danced and laughed, grateful for the bonds that brought them together and the stories that would be passed down for generations to come."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "spp_profile", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Following that year's April Budget, Alderman Sir Cuthbert Ackroyd, who later became Lord Mayor of London, bought the first what on 1 November 1956?", "Produced between 1970 and 1974, what is a Bond Bug?", "What was Jacques Cousteau's mobile oceonagraphic laboratory.", "What is the name of the helicopter used to transport the President of the United States", "Which queen consort of England is associated with Hever Castle in Kent?"], "answers": [["ERNIE", "Premium bond", "Premium bonds", "Premium Bond", "Premium Bonds", "Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment", "ernie", "premium bond", "premium bonds", "electronic random number indicator equipment"], ["Automotive vehicle", "Ottomobile", "Automobile", "Environmental impact of cars", "Self-rolling carriage", "\ud83d\ude97", "Motorcar", "\ud83d\ude98", "M1 vehicle", "Cardoor", "Motorization", "Automobil", "Automobiles", "Self-propelling carriage", "Passenger Vehicle", "Automobilism", "A car", "Car", "Motor car", "Passenger vehicles", "Motorisation", "Autos", "Automobles", "The Automobile", "Environmental impact of automobiles", "Motor-car", "Motor Car", "Car Automobile", "Cars", "Passenger vehicle", "automobilism", "automobil", "cars", "passenger vehicles", "autos", "environmental impact of automobiles", "automobile", "motorization", "\ud83d\ude97", "motor car", "automobiles", "\ud83d\ude98", "car", "automobles", "motorcar", "car automobile", "m1 vehicle", "self rolling carriage", "cardoor", "ottomobile", "passenger vehicle", "motorisation", "self propelling carriage", "automotive vehicle", "environmental impact of cars"], ["Calypso", "Callypso", "Calipso", "Calypsos", "Kalypso", "Calypso (disambiguation)", "kalypso", "callypso", "calypso", "calipso", "calypso disambiguation", "calypsos"], ["Marine Two", "Marine Corps One", "Marine One", "Marine I", "Marine one", "Marine 1", "Marine Corps 1", "Marine-One", "marine two", "marine corps one", "marine i", "marine one", "marine 1", "marine corps 1"], ["Anne Boylen", "Anne Bullen", "Anne boelyn", "Anne Boullant", "Ann Boleyn", "Anne Boleyn, 1st Marchioness of Pembroke", "Anne Boelyn", "Ann Bullen", "Anne Boleyn", "Anna Bollina", "Queen Anne Boleyn", "Anne Bolyn", "Anne boleyn", "Anne bolyn", "anne bullen", "anne boylen", "anne boleyn 1st marchioness of pembroke", "anna bollina", "anne bolyn", "ann bullen", "anne boullant", "queen anne boleyn", "ann boleyn", "anne boleyn", "anne boelyn"]], "question_ids": ["qz_5235", "qz_5236", "qz_5252", "qz_5270", "qz_5300"], "topic": "Tangled"}}

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Beauty asked for a beautiful rose, unlike any other in the world.\n\nDuring his journey, Beauty's father got lost in a dense forest. He stumbled upon a mysterious castle, where he found a garden filled with extraordinary roses. As he picked one for Beauty, a terrifying Beast appeared. The Beast was as large as a hippopotamus, which reminded Beauty's father of Reggie Perrin's Mother-in-law.\n\nThe Beast demanded that Beauty's father send Beauty to live with him in the castle as punishment for taking the rose. With a heavy heart, Beauty's father agreed. When Beauty arrived at the castle, she discovered that the Beast was not as frightening as he seemed. He was a former ruler named Harold Wilson, who had been cursed by a wicked witch.\n\nOne day, the Beast invited Beauty to watch a special event in the castle's grand hall. It was a magical reenactment of the Morecambe and Wise Christmas Special from 1978. Beauty was delighted to see Harold Wilson, the former prime minister, appear in the show.\n\nAs the days passed, Beauty and the Beast grew closer. They enjoyed various activities together, such as skiing down the infamous \"Streif\" downhill ski race in Kitzb\u00fchel, Austria, which was magically recreated in the castle's snowy courtyard.\n\nOne evening, the Beast asked Beauty to dance with him. As they danced, the song \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" by Tom Jones and Cerys Matthews played softly in the background. Beauty realized that she had fallen in love with the Beast.\n\nTo break the curse, Beauty had to declare her love for the Beast before the last petal of the enchanted rose fell. As she did so, the Beast transformed back into Prince Harold Wilson. The curse was lifted, and the castle was filled with joy and celebration.\n\nIn the castle's grand library, Beauty discovered a book about the lightest metal under standard conditions.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first.

Tarzan thought of the abacus he had once used to count the stars and added the word to the list.\n\nThe fourth question asked for an 'A' that meant in the open air. Tarzan, who loved dining al fresco with his jungle friends, wrote down the phrase with pride.\n\nFinally, the fifth question was about the first vegetable to be canned. Tarzan remembered the day he had found a can of peas in an abandoned campsite and added \"pea\" to the list of answers.\n\nWith all five answers revealed, the temple wall opened, revealing a hidden chamber filled with treasures.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12.
