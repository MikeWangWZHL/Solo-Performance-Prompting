Elsa was a curious and intelligent girl who loved learning about history and trivia. One day, she stumbled upon a dusty old book in her attic that contained answers to some fascinating questions. Intrigued, Elsa decided to use these answers to create a story that would bring them to life and explore the connections between these historical events and her own family's legacy.\n\nThe year was 1932, and Elsa's great-grandmother, Amelia, was a talented athlete competing in the Olympics. It was a special year, as it marked the first time electric timing devices and a public-address system were used in the games. Amelia was excited to be part of such a groundbreaking event and hoped to make her family proud. Her determination and spirit would later inspire Elsa to pursue her own passions with the same fervor.\n\nYears later, in 1976, Elsa's uncle, George, was appointed as the director of the CIA. He served in this position until 1981, working tirelessly to protect the nation's security. Elsa admired her uncle's dedication and bravery, and she often daydreamed about following in his footsteps. His role as the CIA director shaped Elsa's worldview, instilling in her a strong sense of justice and responsibility.\n\nOne evening, Elsa's parents took her to see a local production of the musical \"My Fair Lady.\" She was captivated by the beautiful costumes, enchanting music, and the song \"The Street Where You Live.\" Elsa couldn't help but hum the tune for days after the performance, imagining herself dancing on that very street. This experience ignited her love for storytelling and the power of art to transport audiences to different times and places.\n\nAs Elsa continued to read through the book, she learned about the failed \"Bomb Plot\" of 1944. The target of this assassination attempt was none other than Adolf Hitler. Elsa was fascinated by the courage of those who had tried to stand up against such a powerful and dangerous leader. This event served as a reminder of the importance of standing up for what is right, even in the face of great adversity.\n\nFinally, Elsa discovered that in the 1980s, a musician named Richard Marx had a number one hit with the song \"Hold On To The Nights.\" She listened to the song and found herself swept away by its emotional lyrics and powerful melody. This song inspired Elsa to explore the power of music in storytelling and its ability to evoke strong emotions in listeners.\n\nInspired by the stories of her great-grandmother, uncle, and the events she had learned about, Elsa decided to write a play that would weave these historical moments together. She worked tirelessly, pouring her heart and soul into the script, and eventually, her play was performed at her school.\n\nThe audience was captivated by Elsa's storytelling, and her play received a standing ovation. Elsa felt a deep sense of pride and accomplishment, knowing that she had brought these important moments in history to life for others to learn from and enjoy. And so, Elsa continued to write, inspired by the world around her, the stories of those who came before her, and the connections between these events that shaped her family's legacy and her own passion for storytelling."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 3, "question_count": 5}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In what year's Olympics were electric timing devices and a public-address system used for the first time?", "Who was the director of the CIA from 1976-81?", "Which musical featured the song The Street Where You Live?", "\"Who was the target of the failed \"\"Bomb Plot\"\" of 1944?\"", "Who had an 80s No 1 hit with Hold On To The Nights?"], "answers": [["In 1912, in Stockholm", "in 1912 in stockholm"], ["George Bush", "George bush", "Goerge Bush", "George W.

Simba couldn't help but hum the tune as he continued to explore the cave.\n\nNext, he found a collection of books, including \"Men Against the Sea\" and \"Pitcairn's Island.\" He realized these were sequels to the famous novel \"Mutiny on the Bounty.\" Simba was fascinated by the tales of adventure and bravery on the high seas, and he spent hours reading the stories.\n\nAs he continued to rummage through the cave, Simba found a worn-out notebook with the name \"Truman Persons\" written on the cover.

Ariel and Flounder were fascinated by the idea of a human having a bear as a friend and wondered if they could ever be friends with a bear themselves.\n\nA few days later, Ariel and Flounder were watching another television show that had been brought down to the ocean floor. This time, it was a 1970s show called \"All in the Family.\" They enjoyed the show's humor and were surprised to learn that it was based on a British show called \"Till Death Us Do Part.\"\n\nInspired by the shows they had watched, Ariel and Flounder decided to organize a trivia night for their underwater community. They believed that sharing their newfound knowledge would bring everyone closer together and create a fun and engaging event for all.\n\nThe trivia night was a huge success, with sea creatures of all kinds participating and learning about human culture. Ariel and Flounder's friendship grew even stronger as they worked together to create a memorable experience for their friends and neighbors.\n\nIn the end, Ariel and Flounder used their newfound knowledge to bring their underwater community closer together, proving that friendship and understanding can bridge the gap between different worlds. And through it all, Ariel and Flounder remained the best of friends, always referring to each other as \"Kemo Sabe.\""], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Who was the youngest brother in the Beach Boys?", "Who first hosted Family Feud?", "What did the Lone Ranger's title Kemo Sabe mean in Apache?", "Who or what was Gentle Ben in the 60s TV series?", "Which 70s show was based on the British show Till Death Us Do Part?"], "answers": [["Carl Wilson", "Carl Wilson discography", "Wilson, Carl Dean", "Carl Dean Wilson", "Wilson, Carl", "carl wilson discography", "carl dean wilson", "carl wilson", "wilson carl dean", "wilson carl"], ["Dick Dawson", "Richard Dawson", "Dickie Dawson", "Colin Lionel Emm", "Colin Emm", "colin lionel emm", "richard dawson", "colin emm", "dickie dawson", "dick dawson"], ["L\u00e8ine bh\u00e0n", "White shirt", "White Shirt", "Leine bhan", "l\u00e8ine bh\u00e0n", "white shirt", "leine bhan"], ["Ursine", "Ursoidea", "Honey pig", "Bears", "Arctos", "Ursidae", "BEAR", "Mating bears", "Bear cub", "Reproductive behavior of bears", "Ursoid", "Cub (bear)", "Bear", "\ud83d\udc3b", "Bear (zoology)", "Sexual behavior of bears", "Bear hibernation", "ursidae", "bear cub", "cub bear", "bear hibernation", "ursoidea", "bear", "reproductive behavior of bears", "honey pig", "ursoid", "bears", "mating bears", "ursine", "\ud83d\udc3b", "arctos", "bear zoology", "sexual behavior of bears"], ["All In The Family", "All in the family", "Justice For All (TV pilot)", "Stretch Cunningham", "All in the Family (US series)", "Those Were the Days (TV pilot)", "All In the Family", "Millard Fillmore High School", "All in the Family", "Justice for All (TV pilot)", "Those Were The Days (TV pilot)", "stretch cunningham", "justice for all tv pilot", "all in family us series", "all in family", "those were days tv pilot", "millard fillmore high school"]], "question_ids": ["tc_888", "tc_905", "tc_935", "tc_938", "tc_945"], "topic": "Little Mermaid"}}

Joey was thrilled to meet the superhero family and eagerly asked for their advice on how to balance her personal life with her athletic career.\n\nAs the event continued, the Incredibles were introduced to Melanie Molitor, the mother of the former tennis world No. 1, Martina Hingis. Melanie shared her experiences as a supportive parent and how she helped her daughter achieve success in the world of tennis.

Tina Turner and Rich Little put on a spectacular show, lifting the spirits of everyone in attendance. As the concert came to an end, the Avengers and The Divider took to the makeshift baseball field for their epic showdown.\n\nThe game was intense, with both sides displaying incredible skill and determination. In the end, it was the Avengers who emerged victorious, thanks in part to Thor's powerful home runs. The Divider, defeated and humbled, agreed to leave the shipyard and its workers in peace.\n\nAs the Avengers celebrated their victory, they couldn't help but reminisce about the 1980 World Series, won by the Philadelphia Phillies. They felt a sense of camaraderie and unity, much like the shipyard workers who had inspired their mission.\n\nWith the shipyard safe and the workers' spirits lifted, the Avengers knew they had made a difference in the lives of the people of Gdansk.

Intrigued by this historical event, the Cat in the Hat set out to learn more about the world outside his usual realm of mischief and fun.\n\nAs he explored the Black Hills, he stumbled upon a peculiar character named Jack Ruby. Jack seemed to be a troubled soul, haunted by the memory of shooting Lee Harvey Oswald in November 1963. The Cat in the Hat, being the curious creature he was, decided to befriend Jack and learn more about his story. Through their conversations, the Cat in the Hat began to understand the complexities of human emotions and the impact of historical events on individuals.\n\nTogether, they ventured further into the Black Hills, where they encountered a retired pilot named Chuck Yeager. Chuck regaled them with tales of his daring feats, including the time he became the first American to travel faster than the speed of sound. The Cat in the Hat was fascinated by these stories and began to see the world in a whole new light. He realized that courage and determination could lead to incredible achievements.\n\nAs their journey continued, the trio met the legendary journalist Barbara Walters. She shared her experiences interviewing influential figures, including her first US president interview with Richard Nixon. The Cat in the Hat was captivated by her stories and realized that there was so much more to the world than just causing mischief. He learned the importance of asking questions and seeking truth in order to better understand the world around him.\n\nInspired by the people he met and the stories he heard, the Cat in the Hat decided to use his newfound knowledge to bring joy and wonder to the children of the world. He returned to his whimsical ways, but with a newfound appreciation for the history and achievements of the world around him. He began incorporating lessons from his journey into his adventures, teaching children about courage, determination, and the importance of asking questions.\n\nAnd so, the Cat in the Hat continued his adventures, forever changed by his journey through the Black Hills and the remarkable people he met along the way. His stories became richer and more meaningful, as he shared the wisdom he had gained with children everywhere, helping them to better understand and appreciate the world they lived in."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 3, "question_count": 5}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["The Black Hills lie between which two rivers?", "In what year was the first in-flight movie shown on an internal flight in the USA.", "Who did Jack Ruby shoot in November 1963?", "Who was the first American to travel faster than the speed of sound?", "Who was the first US president Barbara Walters interviewed?"], "answers": [["Belle Fourche and Cheyenne", "belle fourche and cheyenne"], ["1929", "one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-nine", "one thousand nine hundred and twenty nine", "1929"], ["Oswald the Lone Assassin", "Lone Nut Theory", "Lone gunman", "Lee Oswald", "Lee H.

Their city was running out of glass, a vital material for their buildings and vehicles. The raw material used for making glass, sand, was becoming scarce, and they needed to find a solution quickly.\n\nEmmet, the hero of Bricksburg, gathered his friends to brainstorm ideas. During their discussion, Unikitty mentioned that she had recently learned about the process of evaporation, the change of state from liquid to gas. This sparked an idea in Emmet's mind.\n\nHe proposed that they could use the principles of mathematics, a branch of science with four fundamental principles: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, to calculate the exact amount of sand needed to produce enough glass for the city. With this information, they could then search for new sources of sand more efficiently.\n\nThe team agreed, and they set out on their mission. They knew they needed to act quickly, so they enlisted the help of the fastest animal on two legs, the ostrich. With the ostrich's incredible speed, they were able to cover vast distances in search of sand.\n\nDuring their journey, they stumbled upon a lush, moss-covered forest. Mosses, they learned, were classified as belonging to the plant kingdom's non-vascular plants. As they explored the forest, they discovered a hidden cave filled with sand, the perfect solution to their problem.\n\nWith the help of mathematics, the ostrich's speed, and their newfound knowledge of mosses, Emmet and his friends were able to save Bricksburg from the glass crisis. The citizens rejoiced, and the city continued to thrive, all thanks to the power of knowledge and teamwork.\n---\nFeedback: The response accurately incorporates the answers to the five questions and creates a coherent story set in the Lego Movie universe. The information provided about glass, evaporation, mathematics, the ostrich, and mosses is correct. The story is engaging and demonstrates the importance of knowledge and teamwork.\n\nTo improve the response, it would be helpful to provide more details about the characters' journey and their interactions with each other. Additionally, the story could benefit from a more in-depth explanation of how they used mathematics to calculate the exact amount of sand needed. Overall, the response is well-written and effectively combines the given information into an entertaining story.\n---\nBased on your initial response and the subsequent feedback, revise the response.

They were planning to build a monument to honor their victory over the evil pigs. The monument was to be made of gypsum, a common mineral used to make casts, moulds, blackboard chalk, and plaster of Paris. The birds knew that this material would be perfect for their masterpiece.\n\nAs the construction began, the birds worked tirelessly under the guidance of their leader, Red. One night, as they were admiring their progress, they noticed a bright star in the sky. It was Sirius, a star as bright as 23 Suns, orbited by the Pup. The birds were in awe of its beauty and decided to incorporate its brilliance into their monument.\n\nTo capture the essence of Sirius, the birds decided to use the three primary colors of light: red, green, and blue. They believed that these colors would not only represent the star's brightness but also symbolize their unity and strength as a community.\n\nAs the monument neared completion, the birds realized they needed a final touch to make it truly unique. They decided to incorporate the second lightest chemical element, helium, into their design. By filling the monument with helium, they hoped to make it float majestically above their island, symbolizing their triumph over the pigs.\n\nFinally, the day came to unveil the monument. The birds gathered around, eagerly awaiting the grand reveal. As the monument floated into the sky, they noticed that it was shaped like the mathematical symbol for Pi, with a value of 3.141 to three decimal places. The birds were overjoyed, as they believed that Pi represented the infinite possibilities of their future.\n\nAnd so, the Angry Birds' monument stood as a testament to their victory, their unity, and their bright future. The birds of Bird Island lived happily ever after, knowing that they had created something truly special that would be admired for generations to come.\n---\nFeedback: The response accurately incorporates the answers to the five questions into the story. The information provided is correct, and the story is coherent and engaging. The use of the Angry Birds Movie theme adds a fun and familiar element to the story.\n\nOne minor critique is that the story could have been more detailed in explaining how the birds used the three primary colors of light to represent Sirius' brightness. Additionally, the story could have mentioned how the birds discovered the value of Pi and why they chose it as the shape of their monument.\n\nOverall, the response is well-written and creatively weaves the answers to the questions into the story.\n---\nBased on your initial response and the subsequent feedback, revise the response.

They had heard about a magical library filled with books written by famous authors, including Nick Hornby, who wrote novels like About A Boy, How To Be Good, and High Fidelity. The Rugrats were eager to explore this library and learn more about the world outside their playpen.\n\nAs they crawled their way through the library, they stumbled upon a peculiar game that caught their attention. It was called Tiddlywinks, and it required a squidger, a circular disc between 25mm and 51mm. The Rugrats were fascinated by this game and decided to give it a try. They spent hours playing and laughing, enjoying their newfound discovery.\n\nAs the day went on, the Rugrats grew tired and decided to take a break from their adventure. They found a cozy corner in the library and began to sing songs to pass the time. One of the songs they sang was \"Happy Birthday,\" a melody written by sisters and school teachers Patty and Mildred Hill in Kentucky in 1893. The Rugrats loved singing this song, as it reminded them of the joy and excitement of birthday parties.\n\nAfter their break, the Rugrats continued exploring the library and came across a book about the United Kingdom. They learned about the most common pub name in the UK, which was The Red Lion. Intrigued by this new information, they imagined what it would be like to visit a pub and meet new friends.\n\nAs they continued to daydream, they stumbled upon a miniature pub called \"The Red Lion\" hidden within the library. Excitedly, they crawled inside and discovered characters from a popular British comedy show featuring Harry Enfield. They met Kevin the teenager and his friend, played by Kathy Burke, who were enjoying a non-alcoholic beverage. The Rugrats were amused by the antics of these characters and wished they could spend more time with them.\n\nAs the day came to an end, the Rugrats realized it was time to head back to their playpen.

They had decided to host a unique sports tournament in the Kingdom of Caring, and the chosen game was none other than billiards. The Care Bears were excited to play, with their balls being black and blue, while their opponents, the Care Bear Cousins, had red and yellow balls.\n\nAs the tournament began, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins gathered around the billiards table, which was designed to resemble the Liverpool-Manchester railway line. This railway line held great significance for the Care Bears, as it marked the beginning of the railway age in 1830. The Care Bears loved learning about human history and often incorporated it into their own celebrations. The billiards table featured intricate details of the railway line, with miniature trains and stations adorning its edges.\n\nDuring the tournament, the Care Bears invited a special guest to join them in their festivities. It was none other than the talented actor, Kenneth Branagh, who had played Frankenstein in the 1994 film adaptation. The Care Bears were huge fans of his work and were thrilled to have him join their celebration. Kenneth shared stories from his acting career and even gave the Care Bears some tips on how to improve their billiards skills.\n\nAs the games continued, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins enjoyed listening to music from various artists. They were particularly fascinated by the story of Enrico Caruso, the first person to sell one million records. The Care Bears admired his talent and dedication to his craft, and they hoped to inspire the same passion in their own pursuits. The Kingdom of Caring was filled with the beautiful melodies of Caruso's music, creating a lively and enchanting atmosphere for the tournament.\n\nThroughout the competition, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins displayed great sportsmanship and camaraderie. They cheered each other on and offered words of encouragement, embodying the true spirit of friendship and love. Tenderheart Bear and Brave Heart Lion emerged as the top players, engaging in a thrilling final match that showcased their skill and determination.\n\nAs the day came to an end and the billiards tournament concluded, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins gathered to honor the winners. They spoke of the importance of friendship, love, and caring for one another. They also discussed the concept of the Elysian Fields from Greek mythology, where righteous souls go after death. The Care Bears believed that by spreading love and care throughout their world, they could create their own version of the Elysian Fields right here on Earth.\n\nWith hearts full of love and joy, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins said their goodbyes to Kenneth Branagh and continued to spread their message of caring and friendship throughout the Kingdom of Caring. And so, the magical land of the Care Bears continued to thrive, filled with love, laughter, and the spirit of togetherness."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What sport or pastime would you be playing if your balls were black and blue and your opponent's were red and yellow?", "The age of the railway began in which year with the introduction of the Liverpool-Manchester line?", "Who played Frankenstein in the 1994 film of the same name?", "Who was the first person to sell one million records?", "In Greek mythology, where do righteous souls go after death?"], "answers": [["Croquet mallet", "Lead off striker", "Croquet ball", "Association croquet", "Croquet", "Association Croquet", "lead off striker", "association croquet", "croquet", "croquet ball", "croquet mallet"], ["1830", "one thousand, eight hundred and thirty", "one thousand eight hundred and thirty", "1830"], ["Kenneth Charles Branagh", "Branagh", "Ken Branagh", "Kenneth Brannagh", "Kenneth Brannaugh", "Sir Kenneth Branagh", "Branagh, Kenneth", "Kenneth Branagh", "kenneth brannagh", "kenneth charles branagh", "branagh", "branagh kenneth", "kenneth branagh", "sir kenneth branagh", "ken branagh", "kenneth brannaugh"], ["Errico Caruso", "Enrico Caruso", "Enrique Caruso", "errico caruso", "enrico caruso", "enrique caruso"], ["Alysian fields", "Elysian Fields", "Elysian Fields (disambiguation)", "The Elysian Fields", "Elysiane fields", "Elysian fields", "alysian fields", "elysian fields", "elysiane fields", "elysian fields disambiguation"]], "question_ids": ["qz_2355", "qz_2379", "qz_2384", "qz_2391", "qz_2397"], "topic": "Care Bears"}}

Rainbow Brite's friends, including Starlite and the Color Kids, were there to support her. The quizmaster, a wise and charismatic sprite, took the stage and announced the first question.\n\n\"How many runs did Donald Bradman score in his last ever test match innings?\" he asked. Rainbow Brite quickly buzzed in and answered, \"0 runs!\" The crowd cheered, impressed by her knowledge.\n\nThe second question was about cycling. \"Nicknamed the cannibal, who is the only rider to have won all three jerseys in the same year in the Tour de France?\" Rainbow Brite didn't hesitate and replied, \"Eddy Merckx!\" The audience clapped, amazed by her expertise.\n\nThe third question was a bit more challenging, as it was about comic book characters. \"Whose arch nemesis is the Red Skull?\" Rainbow Brite thought for a moment and then confidently answered, \"Captain America!\" The crowd roared with excitement, as she continued to dominate the competition.\n\nThe fourth question was about a classic television show. \"First appearing on TV in 1967, which detective solved all of his crimes sitting down?\" Rainbow Brite smiled, remembering the show fondly, and said, \"Ironside!\" The audience was in awe of her vast knowledge.\n\nAs the final question approached, the tension in the room grew. Rainbow Brite's friends held their breath, hoping she could answer correctly and secure her victory. The quizmaster asked, \"How many times was Wyatt Earp shot?\" Rainbow Brite paused, thinking back to her studies. She then answered, \"Wyatt Earp was never shot!\" \n\nThe crowd erupted in cheers, as she had answered all five questions correctly. Rainbow Brite was crowned the Sports Trivia Champion, and her victory brought even more joy and color to the magical land. Her friends and fellow inhabitants celebrated her triumph, and they all marveled at her incredible knowledge of sports history.

The team consisted of Jason, the Red Ranger; Kimberly, the Pink Ranger; Zack, the Black Ranger; Trini, the Yellow Ranger; and Billy, the Blue Ranger.\n\nOne day, the Power Rangers received a message from their mentor, Zordon, about a new villain who had surfaced in the town of Gordonstoun. This villain was known as the Duke of Destruction, and he had taken control of the public school that the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles once attended. The Rangers knew they had to act fast to save the students and staff from the Duke's evil clutches.\n\nAs they prepared for their mission, the Rangers discovered that the Duke of Destruction had a powerful ally: the 2009 Masters Champion, \u00c1ngel Cabrera. He had been corrupted by the Duke's evil influence and was using his golf skills to wreak havoc on the town. The Rangers knew they had to defeat both the Duke and Cabrera to restore peace to Gordonstoun.\n\nUpon arriving at the school, the Rangers were confronted by a surreal scene that looked like it was taken straight from Salvador Dali's painting, \"The Persistence of Memory.\" Clocks were oozing over the landscape, distorting time and space. The Rangers realized that this was the work of the Duke of Destruction, who was using the power of the painting to control time itself.\n\nAs the Rangers fought their way through the twisted landscape, they encountered a pair of unlikely allies: the Earl and Countess of Wessex, who lived at Bagshot Park in Surrey. The royal couple had heard of the Rangers' mission and had come to help them defeat the Duke of Destruction and free the school. It turned out that the Earl and Countess were old friends of Zordon, who had helped them in the past, and they felt compelled to repay the favor.\n\nTogether, the Power Rangers and the Earl and Countess of Wessex confronted the Duke of Destruction and \u00c1ngel Cabrera in a fierce battle. The Rangers used their martial arts skills and powerful weapons to defeat Cabrera, breaking the spell that had turned him evil. With Cabrera's help, they then turned their attention to the Duke of Destruction.\n\nIn the final showdown, the Rangers discovered that the Duke of Destruction was none other than the notorious murderer who had once lived at 10 Rillington Place. The evil spirit of the murderer had been resurrected and given new power by an unknown force. The Rangers combined their powers and, with the help of the Earl and Countess of Wessex, defeated the Duke of Destruction once and for all.\n\nWith the school and town of Gordonstoun saved, the Power Rangers returned to Angel Grove, knowing that they had once again protected the world from evil. The people of Gordonstoun were forever grateful to the Rangers and their royal allies, and peace was restored to the land.\n\nThe Power Rangers' victory over the Duke of Destruction and \u00c1ngel Cabrera not only saved the town of Gordonstoun but also strengthened the bond between the Rangers and their royal allies. The experience taught the Rangers the importance of teamwork and the power of friendship, as they continued to protect the world from evil forces."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What public school did the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles attend?", "If it was Phil Mickelson in 2006, Zach Johnson in 2007, and Trevor Immelman in 2008, who was it in 2009?", "What is the name of the Salvador Dali painting that shows clocks oozing over a landscape?", "Which well known couple live at Bagshot Park in Surrey?", "Which notorious murderer lived at 10 Rillington Place?"], "answers": [["Gordonstoun School", "Gordonstun", "Gordonstown", "Gordonstoun", "Gordonston", "Gordonstounians", "Gordonstone", "gordonstoun school", "gordonston", "gordonstown", "gordonstounians", "gordonstone", "gordonstoun", "gordonstun"], ["Angel Cabrera", "Ping\u00fcino Cabrera", "Pato Cabrera", "\u00c1ngel Miguel Cabrera", "El ornitorrinco de C\u00f3rdoba", "\u00c1ngel Cabrera", "ping\u00fcino cabrera", "\u00e1ngel cabrera", "pato cabrera", "\u00e1ngel miguel cabrera", "el ornitorrinco de c\u00f3rdoba", "angel cabrera"], ["Persistance of Memory", "Drooping clocks", "Soft Watches", "Melting Clocks", "The Persistence of Memory", "Melted clocks", "La persistencia de la memoria", "The Peristence of Memory", "The Persistance of Memory", "La Persist\u00e8ncia de la Mem\u00f2ria", "The persistence of memory", "The Persistence Of Memory", "La persistencia de memoria", "La Persistencia de Memoria", "La Persistance de la memoire", "persistance of memory", "la persistencia de la memoria", "drooping clocks", "persistence of memory", "la persistencia de memoria", "la persistance de la memoire", "la persist\u00e8ncia de la mem\u00f2ria", "soft watches", "melting clocks", "peristence of memory", "melted clocks"], ["HRH The Earl of Wessex", "Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex", "Prince Edward of the United Kingdom", "The Prince Edward", "Edward Windsor, Earl of Wessex", "Earl and Countess of Wessex", "Ardent Productions", "Prince Edward, 1st Earl of Wessex", "HRH Prince Edward", "Edward Wessex", "Edward, 1st Earl of Wessex", "The Earl of Wessex", "Edward, Earl of Wessex", "The Earl and Countess of Wessex", "HRH The Prince Edward", "Edward Anthony Richard Windsor", "earl of wessex", "hrh earl of wessex", "edward anthony richard windsor", "prince edward earl of wessex", "earl and countess of wessex", "edward windsor earl of wessex", "prince edward", "hrh prince edward", "edward wessex", "prince edward 1st earl of wessex", "edward 1st earl of wessex", "edward earl of wessex", "prince edward of united kingdom", "ardent productions"], ["John Christie (footballer)", "John Christie (disambiguation)", "Christie, John", "John Christie", "john christie", "john christie footballer", "john christie disambiguation", "christie john"]], "question_ids": ["qz_2908", "qz_2933", "qz_2980", "qz_3023", "qz_3027"], "topic": "Power Rangers"}}

In the movie, Pamela played a tough, resourceful character who could handle any situation. Inspired by her character, the friends decided to tackle the wireworm problem head-on. They researched ways to get rid of the pests and worked together to restore the park to its original beauty.\n\nWith the wireworm problem solved, the friends continued planning their Bakugan tournament. They wanted to add a touch of humor to the event, so they decided to screen a movie during the tournament. They chose the 2004 \"puppet\" movie \"Team America: World Police,\" made by the creators of South Park. The movie satirized American politics and jingoism, and the friends believed it would provide some comic relief during the intense Bakugan battles.\n\nFinally, the day of the tournament arrived. The park was filled with Bakugan enthusiasts, excited to participate in the unique challenges and meet Caroline Aherne. The Bakugan-themed ice slide was a huge hit, and the screening of \"Team America: World Police\" had everyone laughing. The friends' hard work and determination had paid off, making their Bakugan tournament a memorable and successful event.\n---\nFeedback: The response successfully incorporates the answers to the five questions into a coherent story about a Bakugan tournament. The information provided is accurate, and the story flows well from one event to another. The characters' actions and decisions are connected to the information from the questions, making the story engaging and relevant.\n\nOne area that could be improved is the transition between the different pieces of information. Some of the connections between the facts feel a bit forced, and the story could benefit from smoother transitions. For example, the introduction of the \"Barb Wire\" movie could be more naturally integrated into the story by having the friends watch the movie together and then get inspired by Pamela Anderson's character.\n\nAdditionally, the story could be more engaging by adding more depth to the characters and their relationships with each other. This would help the reader connect with the story and make it more enjoyable to read.\n\nOverall, the response does a good job of creating a coherent story that incorporates the answers to the five questions. With some minor improvements to transitions and character development, the story could be even more engaging and enjoyable.\n---\nBased on your initial response and the subsequent feedback, revise the response.

They would spend hours playing the game and discussing strategies. One day, they decided to organize a Bakugan tournament in their town, and they wanted to make it the most memorable event ever.\n\nThe friends thought it would be a great idea to have a celebrity guest at their tournament. They recalled that the character Mrs. Merton was played by the talented Caroline Aherne on TV. They decided to invite her to their event, hoping that her presence would attract more people to participate in the tournament.\n\nAs they were planning the event, they wanted to add some excitement to the tournament by incorporating a unique challenge. They remembered the Cresta Run, an ice skeleton racing toboggan track located in St. Moritz, Switzerland, which was a Winter Olympic host city. They decided to create a Bakugan-themed ice slide, inspired by the Cresta Run, where participants would have to slide their Bakugan balls down the track to reach their opponents.\n\nDuring the preparations for the tournament, the friends encountered an unexpected problem. Wireworms, which are actually a type of larvae of click beetles, had infested the park where they planned to hold the event. The wireworms were causing damage to the grass and plants, making it difficult to set up the Bakugan playing fields. The friends knew they had to find a solution to save their event.\n\nOne evening, as the friends were brainstorming solutions, they decided to take a break and watch a movie together.

The town had lost its Christmas spirit, and it was up to Boss Baby to bring it back. As he wandered through the town, he heard a song playing from a nearby radio. It was \"Only You\" by The Flying Pickets, the Christmas number one hit from 1983. The song brought back memories of happier times, and Boss Baby knew that music would be the key to saving Christmas.\n\nBoss Baby decided to form a band to spread Christmas cheer throughout the town. He needed to find the perfect bandmates, so he started his search at the local football field. There, he met a group of musicians who called themselves \"Kaiser Chiefs,\" named after a South African football team. They were eager to help Boss Baby in his quest to save Christmas.\n\nAs they began to practice, Boss Baby realized they needed a catchy name for their band. He picked up a small newspaper that was lying on the ground and noticed it was a unique size. It was smaller than a tabloid but larger than a broadsheet. The name \"Berliner\" was printed on the front page, which was the name given to the smallest size of newspapers. Boss Baby decided to name their band \"The Berliner Beats.\"\n\nThe Berliner Beats practiced day and night, perfecting their sound and preparing for their big debut. They decided to perform a concert on the town's founding anniversary, which was traditionally celebrated with paper decorations and gifts. The townspeople were excited about the upcoming event, and the buzz around town began to grow.\n\nOn the day of the concert, the town square was filled with people holding paper decorations and gifts, symbolizing the unity and interconnectedness of the community. The Berliner Beats took the stage, and Boss Baby led the band in a rousing rendition of \"Only You.\" The crowd was captivated, and the Christmas spirit began to fill the air.\n\nAs the concert continued, a surprise guest appeared on stage.

The people of Brave welcomed the ThunderCats with open arms, and they quickly became beloved figures in the community, their heroic deeds becoming the stuff of legend.\n\nIn the heart of Brave, there was a gang led by the cunning Top Cat, whose members included the loyal Benny the Ball, the clever Brain, and the charming Choo Choo. They were mischievous but ultimately good-hearted, and they often found themselves in trouble with the law. However, they had a strong sense of loyalty and always looked out for one another, their camaraderie a testament to the bonds of friendship.\n\nOne day, as Simple Simon was on his way to the fair, he encountered Top Cat and his gang. They struck up a conversation, and Simple Simon found himself fascinated by their stories of adventure and mischief. Top Cat, sensing an opportunity for some fun, invited Simple Simon to join them on their next escapade. Simple Simon, eager for excitement, agreed without hesitation.\n\nAs they embarked on their adventure, they stumbled upon a hidden treasure \u2013 a rare comic strip featuring a character named Dennis the Menace, who first appeared in The Beano in 1951. The gang was ecstatic, as they knew this comic strip was worth a fortune. However, they also realized that they had a responsibility to use this newfound wealth for the greater good.\n\nWith the help of the ThunderCats, Top Cat and his gang decided to use the money from the sale of the comic strip to improve the lives of the people in Brave. They built schools, hospitals, and parks, and the town flourished under their care. The ThunderCats and Top Cat's gang learned to work together, their combined efforts creating a brighter future for the people of Brave.\n\nAs for Simple Simon, he found a sense of belonging with Top Cat and his gang, his life now filled with adventure and camaraderie. He discovered that even the simplest of people could make a difference in the world.\n\nAnd so, the people of Brave lived happily ever after, their lives enriched by the music of John Denver, the protection of the ThunderCats, and the good deeds of Top Cat and his gang. The land of Brave became a shining example of what could be achieved when people came together, united by the power of friendship, heroism, and the pursuit of a better tomorrow."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Who had chart hits which included Annie`s Song and Rocky Mountain High?", "Which cartoon series featured the characters Lion-o, Cheetera, Tygra and Snarf/", "Who was the leader of the gang whose members included Benny the Ball ,Brain and Choo Choo?", "Who did Simple Simon meet on his way to the fair?", "Which cartoon strip character first appeared in The Beano in 1951?"], "answers": [["Henry Deutschendorf, Junior", "Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr.", "For Baby (For Bobbie)", "Henry Deutschendorf", "John DENVER", "John Deutschendorf", "Henry Deutschendorf, Jr.", "Annie denver", "Henry John Deutschendorf", "Henry John Deutschendorf, Junior", "John Denver", "john deutschendorf", "henry john deutschendorf", "henry deutschendorf junior", "annie denver", "henry john deutschendorf jr", "for baby for bobbie", "henry deutschendorf jr", "henry john deutschendorf junior", "john denver", "henry deutschendorf"], ["ThunderCats (1985 TV series)", "The ThunderCats", "Thunder cats", "Thundercats outtakes", "Monkian", "Thunder Cats", "Thuder Cat", "Thundercats.", "Thundrilliam", "The Thunder Cats", "Slithe", "Thunder Cat", "Jackalman", "thundercats outtakes", "thundercats 1985 tv series", "slithe", "thunder cat", "thundrilliam", "thundercats", "jackalman", "monkian", "thunder cats", "thuder cat"], ["Brain (Top Cat character", "Top Cat.", "Top Cat", "Top cat", "Boss Cat", "top cat", "boss cat", "brain top cat character"], ["Pieman (disambiguation)", "Pie man", "The Pie man.", "Pieman", "Pie Man", "pieman", "pieman disambiguation", "pie man"], ["Denis the Menace", "Dennis the Menace.", "Dennis the Menace (disambiguation)", "Denis the Menice", "Dennis the Menace (TV series)", "Dennis the Mennis", "Dennis the Menace (television)", "Dennis The Menace", "Dennis the Menace", "dennis mennis", "dennis menace tv series", "dennis menace", "dennis menace disambiguation", "denis menice", "dennis menace television", "denis menace"]], "question_ids": ["qz_5044", "qz_5050", "qz_5053", "qz_5202", "qz_5203"], "topic": "Brave"}}

As he sorted through the relics of the past, he stumbled upon a vinyl record of The Beatles. Intrigued, Wall-E learned about the band's history and found out that Pete Best was sacked as their drummer and replaced by Ringo Starr. This fact fascinated Wall-E, and he decided to learn more about human history, hoping to understand the complexities of human emotions and relationships that led to the world's current state.\n\nAs Wall-E dug deeper into the past, he discovered information about the abdications of monarchs in 1917. He learned that Tsar Nicholas II of Russia abdicated during this period, as well as another monarch, King Manuel II of Portugal. Wall-E was amazed by the power struggles and changes in leadership that occurred throughout human history. He began to see parallels between these power struggles and the reasons behind Earth's abandonment, as humanity's quest for power and control had ultimately led to its downfall.\n\nOne day, Wall-E found a tattered copy of Shakespeare's play, \"Julius Caesar.\" He read the tragic story and was moved by the last words of Julius Caesar, \"Et tu, Brute?\" Wall-E couldn't help but feel empathy for the betrayed leader and pondered the complexities of human relationships. He realized that betrayal and the thirst for power were recurring themes in human history, contributing to the destruction of the planet.\n\nAs Wall-E continued to explore the remnants of human culture, he discovered a collection of old movies. Among them were two films featuring the same character, played by Mel Gibson in 1990 and Kenneth Branagh in 1996. Wall-E was captivated by the story of Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark, and the themes of revenge, betrayal, and tragedy that seemed to be a recurring pattern in human history. He began to understand that these themes were not only present in fictional stories but also reflected the reality of human nature.\n\nOne day, while watching a documentary about the history of cinema, Wall-E learned about the founding of the original United Artists film studio in 1919. The studio was established by four legendary figures: D.W. Griffith, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and Charlie Chaplin. Wall-E was inspired by their collaborative spirit and the impact they had on the world of entertainment. He saw the potential for art and storytelling to bring people together and promote positive change.\n\nAs Wall-E continued to learn about human history, he gained a deeper understanding of humanity's strengths and weaknesses. He hoped that one day, he could share these stories with the humans who had left Earth, helping them to remember their past and learn from the mistakes that led to the world's current state. And so, Wall-E continued his mission, preserving the remnants of human history and culture, waiting for the day when he could share these treasures with the people who had once called Earth their home."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Who was sacked as the Beatles' drummer and replaced by Ringo Starr?", "Tsar Nicholas I abidacated in 1917, who was the other monarch to abdicate during this period?", "Whose last words were Et Tu Brute according to Shakespeare?", "Mel Gibson (1990) and Kenneth Branagh (1996) have both played which character in movies?", "The original United Artists film studio was founded in 1919 by D.W.
