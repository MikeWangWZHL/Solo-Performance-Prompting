One of her favorite shows was \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" which featured the hit song \"If I Were A Rich Man.\" She also had a passion for literature, particularly the novel \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" and its sequels \"Men Against the Sea\" and \"Pitcairn's Island.\"\n\nHer best friend, Truman, shared her love for literature. Interestingly, Truman's last name was Persons, the same as Truman Capote's original last name before he was adopted by his stepfather. Elsa and Truman often spent hours discussing their favorite books and poems, including Lewis Carroll's \"The Hunting of the Snark,\" in which the elusive, troublesome snark turned into a boojum to fool hunters.\n\nTheir conversations also delved into biblical stories, such as the one where the sun and moon stood still before Joshua. Elsa and Truman enjoyed exploring the deeper meanings behind these stories and how they related to their own lives.\n\nOne day, they decided to watch the movie \"Dangerous Minds,\" starring Michelle Pfeiffer.

One day, he met Peter O'Toole, the male star of the movie The Man of La Mancha, who had been researching for a new role. Peter shared some valuable insights with Spider-Man about the importance of perseverance and fighting for justice.\n\nDuring one of his heroic acts, Spider-Man was interviewed by Joey Richardson, a talented reporter and niece of the famous actress Vanessa Redgrave. Joey was eager to share Spider-Man's story with the world, highlighting his bravery and dedication to keeping the city safe.\n\nOne day, Spider-Man received a distress call from Melanie Molitor, the mother of tennis world No. 1 player. Her daughter had been kidnapped, and Spider-Man immediately swung into action. He tracked down the kidnappers to an abandoned building, eerily similar to the 'house of horrors' in Belgium, where the notorious criminal Marc Dutroux had once held his victims captive.

Mr. Potato Head chimed in, \"That would be 22 titles!\" The toys were amazed by their collective knowledge.\n\nThe next question was, \"The Black Hills lie between which two rivers?\" Bo Peep thought for a moment and then answered, \"The Cheyenne and the Belle Fourche rivers.\" The toys were learning so much from this trivia game.\n\n\"In what year was the first in-flight movie shown on an internal flight in the USA?\" the TV asked. Hamm, the piggy bank, responded, \"That was in 1961!\" The toys were getting better at this game.\n\n\"Who did Jack Ruby shoot in November 1963?\" was the next question. Jessie, the cowgirl, knew this one, \"That was Lee Harvey Oswald!\" The toys were surprised by the dark turn in the trivia questions.\n\nThe TV then asked, \"Who was the first American to travel faster than the speed of sound?\" Buzz Lightyear proudly answered, \"That was Chuck Yeager!\" The toys were in awe of the brave pilot.\n\nFinally, the last question was, \"Who was the first US president Barbara Walters interviewed?\" Woody knew this one, \"That was Richard Nixon!\" The toys were proud of their performance in the trivia game.\n\nAs the trivia show ended, the Toy Story gang realized how much they had learned and bonded over the experience.

A mysterious villain had been leaving cryptic clues around the world, and it was up to the team to decipher them and save the day.

Meanwhile, Peter Parker was excitedly talking about his favorite soccer player, Thierry Henry, who held the record for scoring the most league goals for Arsenal as of March 2001.\n\nThe team continued to follow the clues, which led them to an underground bunker built during the time of the Berlin Wall. \"This place was constructed when JFK was the American President,\" Steve Rogers mentioned, recalling his history lessons.\n\nInside the bunker, they found a room with a darts board. Natasha Romanoff, being an expert in precision, quickly realized that the minimum number of darts needed to complete a leg from 501 was nine. She threw the darts accordingly, and a hidden door opened, revealing another clue.\n\nThis time, it was a framed photo of the Celtic football team, the first British team to win the European Cup. As they continued through the bunker, they found a table with a standard set of 28 dominoes. Clint Barton, being skilled in strategy, quickly arranged the dominoes in a specific pattern, unlocking yet another hidden passage.\n\nThe Avengers soon found themselves in a room with two cages, labeled \"Benjy\" and \"Laska.\" They realized that these were the names of the two animals sent into space in 1958. The cages were empty, but the room contained a map of the London Underground. Tony noticed that the Jubilee Line was highlighted, as it was the only line to connect with every other line on the system.\n\nAs they followed the map, they found themselves in a dark tunnel. Bruce mentioned that Thomas Edison, the inventor of the lightbulb, was afraid of the dark, just like Tony, who had developed a slight fear after his experience in space.\n\nFinally, the Avengers reached the villain's lair and successfully thwarted their plans.

Meanwhile, Peter Parker was excitedly talking about his favorite soccer player, Thierry Henry, who held the record for scoring the most league goals for Arsenal as of March 2001.\n\nThe team continued to follow the clues, which led them to an underground bunker built during the time of the Berlin Wall. \"This place was constructed when JFK was the American President,\" Steve Rogers mentioned, recalling his history lessons.\n\nInside the bunker, they found a room with a darts board. Natasha Romanoff, being an expert in precision, quickly realized that the minimum number of darts needed to complete a leg from 501 was nine. She threw the darts accordingly, and a hidden door opened, revealing another clue.\n\nThis time, it was a framed photo of the Celtic football team, the first British team to win the European Cup. As they continued through the bunker, they found a table with a standard set of 28 dominoes. Clint Barton, being skilled in strategy, quickly arranged the dominoes in a specific pattern, unlocking yet another hidden passage.\n\nThe Avengers soon found themselves in a room with two cages, labeled \"Benjy\" and \"Laska.\" They realized that these were the names of the two animals sent into space in 1958. The cages were empty, but the room contained a map of the London Underground. Tony noticed that the Jubilee Line was highlighted, as it was the only line to connect with every other line on the system.\n\nAs they followed the map, they found themselves in a dark tunnel. Bruce mentioned that Thomas Edison, the inventor of the lightbulb, was afraid of the dark, just like Tony, who had developed a slight fear after his experience in space.\n\nFinally, the Avengers reached the villain's lair and successfully thwarted their plans. The world was saved once again, thanks to their teamwork and ability to decipher the cryptic clues left behind."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 6, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What was advertised with Eva Herzagovia using the slogan hello boys?", "What number in Bingo is sometimes referred to as Heinz varieties?", "As at March 2001, who holds the record for scoring the most league goals for the soccer team Arsenal?", "Who was the American President when the Berlin Wall was constructed?", "What is the minimum number of darts a person needs to throw to complete a leg from 501?", "What was the first British football team to win the European Cup?", "How many pieces are there in a standard set of dominoes?", "What were Benjy and Laska, which were sent into space in 1958?", "On the London Underground, which is the only line to connect at some point with every other line on the system?", "Thomas Edison, who invented the lightbulb, was afraid of the dark?"], "answers": [["Wonderbra.", "Wonder-bra", "The Wonderbra", "WonderBra", "Wonderbra", "The Wonder-Bra", "Wonder Bra", "Wonderbra Women", "wonderbra", "wonderbra women", "wonder bra"], ["57", "fifty-seven", "fifty seven", "57"], ["Mr Wright", "Ian Wright", "ian wright", "mr wright"], ["JFK", "J.F.K", "J.F.K.

Among the guests was an American female rap artist, film, and television actress who had released a song called \"Paper\" in 1998, Queen Latifah.\n\nAs the party went on, Fred struck up a conversation with one of the guests about the 2010 Giro D'Italia, reminiscing about the victory of Ivan Basso. Another guest, a British athlete who had won the men's 200m gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi, Leon Baptiste, shared his experiences and achievements.\n\nThe party was in full swing when a singer who had recently won three Ivor Novello awards for her hit single, \"The Fear,\" joined the celebration.

Incorporate the answers to the 10 questions into the story as the kids learn about each historical figure or event.\n\nStory:\nCharlie was a young boy who loved playing baseball with his friends in the Sandlot. One day, while rummaging through his attic, he discovered a mysterious box filled with memorabilia from various historical figures and events. Excited by his find, Charlie decided to share it with his friends and use the items to inspire their games and learn about history.\n\nThe first item Charlie pulled out of the box was a quote from a British monarch, Queen Elizabeth I, who famously said, \"I don't wish to open windows into men's souls.\" Intrigued by the quote, the kids decided to play a game where they had to guess each other's thoughts and feelings, just like the queen.\n\nNext, Charlie found a poster of the 1986 film 'Labyrinth,' featuring British singer David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King. The kids were fascinated by the movie and decided to create their own labyrinth in the Sandlot, complete with goblin-like obstacles.\n\nAs they continued to explore the box, the kids discovered a DVD of the 1987 film 'Cry Freedom,' a biographical drama about South African civil rights leader Steve Biko. Inspired by Biko's courage and determination, the kids decided to play a game where they had to overcome challenges and stand up for their beliefs.\n\nCharlie then pulled out a photograph of British actress Kathy Burke, who played Valerie in the 1997 film 'Nil By Mouth.' The kids were impressed by her acting skills and decided to put on a play in the Sandlot, with each of them taking on different roles.\n\nThe next item was a tennis racket signed by Maria Bueno, the Brazilian player who won the Women's Singles Finals at Wimbledon in 1959, 1960, and 1964. The kids decided to have a friendly tennis match in the Sandlot, with each of them trying to channel Maria's winning spirit.\n\nCharlie then found a model of the steam locomotive Mallard, which set the world speed record in July 1938 by reaching 126 mph on the East Coast Mainline in England. The kids were amazed by the train's speed and decided to have a race around the Sandlot to see who could run the fastest.\n\nAs they continued to dig through the box, the kids found a ticket stub from a concert at the venue that singer and musician Bono called \"rock and roll's great cathedral\" - Slane Castle in Ireland. Inspired by the music, the kids decided to form a band and perform their own concert in the Sandlot.\n\nNext, they discovered a book about the 5th/6th Century Buddhist monk Bodhidharma, who was described in Chinese texts as \"The Blue-Eyed Barbarian.\" The kids were fascinated by his teachings and decided to practice mindfulness and meditation during their games.\n\nCharlie then found a newspaper article about the only hijacking of a British commercial flight, which occurred in 1974. The kids were shocked by the event and decided to play a game where they had to protect their Sandlot from imaginary hijackers.\n\nFinally, Charlie pulled out a model of the Cunard ocean liner Lusitania, which was launched on 20th September 1906. The kids were in awe of the ship's size and grandeur, and they decided to build their own cardboard ship in the Sandlot.\n\nThrough the mysterious box, Charlie and his friends not only had fun playing games in the Sandlot but also learned about history and the incredible people and events that shaped the world."}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 803, "prompt_tokens": 277, "total_tokens": 1080}, "prompt": "Write a short and coherent story about Sandlot that incorporates the answers to the following 10 questions: Which British monarch famously said \u2018I don\u2019t wish to open windows into men\u2019s souls\u2019?

They quickly became friends and decided to work together to find the treasure. As they searched the city, they came across a peculiar sight: a group of people playing croquet using hedgehogs as balls, just like in the novel 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'. Rainbow Brite and Miroslav couldn't help but join in the fun.\n\nAfter the game, they decided to take a break and enjoy some Belgian Kriek beer, which was flavored with cherries. As they sipped their drinks, Miroslav mentioned a quote from the book 'The Lost Continent' by Bill Bryson: \"I came from Des Moines. Somebody had to.\" Rainbow Brite found the quote amusing and wondered if the treasure they were seeking had any connection to the author.\n\nAs they continued their search, they stumbled upon a mural depicting the actor who succeeded Marlon Brando as the head of the Corleone family in the Godfather films, Al Pacino. Rainbow Brite and Miroslav took this as a sign that they were on the right track.\n\nTheir journey led them to a river, where they spotted various types of fish, including Brown, American Rainbow, and Cutthroat trout. They decided to follow the river, hoping it would lead them to the treasure.\n\nAs they walked along the riverbank, they came across a bottle of Parfait d'Amour, a purple liqueur. They decided to celebrate their progress by sharing the drink. As they toasted to their adventure, Rainbow Brite mentioned the 2005 Julian Barnes novel 'Arthur and George', wondering if the character Arthur could have been involved in hiding the treasure.\n\nWith renewed determination, Rainbow Brite and Miroslav continued their search, confident that they would soon uncover the lost treasure of the Corleone family and solve the mystery that had brought them together."}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 631, "prompt_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 856}, "prompt": "Write a short and coherent story about Rainbow Brite that incorporates the answers to the following 10 questions: What did fictional detective Sherlock Holmes keep in the toe of his Persian slipper?

As she embarked on her journey, she couldn't help but think of the famous detective Sherlock Holmes, who kept tobacco in the toe of his Persian slipper. She wondered if he would have been able to solve this mystery.\n\nUpon arriving in Leicester, Rainbow Brite met a Serbo-Croatian man named Miroslav, who was a huge fan of the UK TV series 'Mucke'. They quickly became friends and decided to work together to find the treasure. As they searched the city, they came across a peculiar sight: a group of people playing croquet using hedgehogs as balls, just like in the novel 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'. Rainbow Brite and Miroslav couldn't help but join in the fun.\n\nAfter the game, they decided to take a break and enjoy some Belgian Kriek beer, which was flavored with cherries. As they sipped their drinks, Miroslav mentioned a quote from the book 'The Lost Continent' by Bill Bryson: \"I came from Des Moines. Somebody had to.\" Rainbow Brite found the quote amusing and wondered if the treasure they were seeking had any connection to the author.\n\nAs they continued their search, they stumbled upon a mural depicting the actor who succeeded Marlon Brando as the head of the Corleone family in the Godfather films, Al Pacino. Rainbow Brite and Miroslav took this as a sign that they were on the right track.\n\nTheir journey led them to a river, where they spotted various types of fish, including Brown, American Rainbow, and Cutthroat trout. They decided to follow the river, hoping it would lead them to the treasure.\n\nAs they walked along the riverbank, they came across a bottle of Parfait d'Amour, a purple liqueur. They decided to celebrate their progress by sharing the drink. As they toasted to their adventure, Rainbow Brite mentioned the 2005 Julian Barnes novel 'Arthur and George', wondering if the character Arthur could have been involved in hiding the treasure.\n\nWith renewed determination, Rainbow Brite and Miroslav continued their search, confident that they would soon uncover the lost treasure of the Corleone family and solve the mystery that had brought them together."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 9, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What did fictional detective Sherlock Holmes keep in the toe of his Persian slipper?", "Which creatures are used as croquet balls in the novel \u2018Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u2019?", "\u2018Mucke\u2019 is the Serbo-Croatian name for which UK tv series?", "The Belgian beer \u2018Kriek\u2019 is flavoured with which fruit?", "In which British city is the Jewry Wall Museum?", "Which author wrote \u2018I came form Des Moines.

They discussed their strategy and drew inspiration from the novel 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,' which reminded them of the importance of unity and teamwork.\n\nAs the Power Rangers prepared for battle, they learned that the villain was working with the infamous Fu Manchu, who was on a quest to find the sword and mask of a historical figure. The mask, worn in the 1996 film 'Scream,' was based on a painting by a famous artist and held immense power.\n\nDetermined to stop Fu Manchu and save the world, the Power Rangers fought valiantly. They looked up to the US athlete who won a gold medal for the high jump in the 1968 Summer Olympics, using his determination and skill as motivation.\n\nIn the end, the Power Rangers defeated Fu Manchu and the villain who controlled the 'Daily Universal Register.'

They were fascinated by her findings and invited her to give a talk at their stadium, hoping to inspire their players and fans with the story of human resilience during the Ice Age.\n\nIn the end, Margo Channing's discoveries led to a breakthrough in understanding the Ice Age and its effects on the world. Her passion for uncovering the past had not only brought her fame and recognition but also contributed to a deeper understanding of human history."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which country was formerly known by the Greeks as Tylos?", "Who played Margo Channing in the 1950 film \u2018All About Eve\u2019?", "Who is the host of the BBC television show QI?", "What is the name of the cockerel in the UK television series \u2018The Good Life\u2019?", "In humans, Gorham disease affects which part of the body?", "Which English Rugby Union team play their home games at Adams Park?", "In the UK television series \u2018Dad\u2019s Army\u2019, what was Lance-Corpopal Jack Jones occupation?", "What is the name of the fictional club in the James Bond novel \u2018Moonraker\u2019?", "Who published a 1754 book of his designs entitled \u2018The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker\u2019s Director\u2019?", "Barney the Owl is a mascot of which English football club?"], "answers": [["Asia/Bahrain", "\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646", "Bahrein", "Bahrayn", "Dawlat al-Bahrain", "Bahrein Islands", "Etymology of Bahrain", "Bahrain", "Bahrain islands", "Bahraih", "\u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646", "Languages of Bahrain", "Emirate of Bahrain", "ISO 3166-1:BH", "Bahrain Islands", "Mamlakat al-Ba\u1e25rayn", "Bahrain's", "Bahrain/Geography", "Al-Ba\u1e25rayn", "Barhain", "Kingdom of Bahrain", "1923 Sitrah Outrage", "Al-Bahrayn", "iso 3166 1 bh", "bahrain", "barhain", "bahrayn", "languages of bahrain", "al ba\u1e25rayn", "emirate of bahrain", "mamlakat al ba\u1e25rayn", "bahrain geography", "dawlat al bahrain", "etymology of bahrain", "bahrein islands", "bahrain s", "\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646", "1923 sitrah outrage", "bahrain islands", "asia bahrain", "bahrein", "kingdom of bahrain", "al bahrayn", "\u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646", "bahraih"], ["Ruth Davis", "Arthur Farnsworth.", "Harmon Nelson", "Davis, Bette", "Bette Davies", "Arthur Farnsworth (Bette Davis' husband)", "Ruth Elizabeth Davis", "Bette Davis", "Ruth Elizabeth %22Bette%22 Davis", "Bettie Davis", "ruth davis", "arthur farnsworth", "arthur farnsworth bette davis husband", "bettie davis", "davis bette", "ruth elizabeth 22bette 22 davis", "ruth elizabeth davis", "bette davies", "harmon nelson", "bette davis"], ["Stephen Fry", "Stephen fry", "Steven fry", "Steve Fry", "@stephenfry", "Steven Fry", "Rescuing the Spectacled Bear", "stephen fry", "stephenfry", "rescuing spectacled bear", "steven fry", "steve fry"], ["N.

Despite his taphophobia, the fear of being buried alive, Brave mustered all his courage and ventured into the tomb. There, he found the evidence that proved his friends' innocence and exposed the true culprits behind the phone-hacking scandal.\n\nWith the truth revealed, Brave's friends were freed, and their names were cleared. To celebrate their victory, they gathered together to watch a Disney film featuring Nani, Cobra Bubbles, and Captain Gantu - Lilo & Stitch.

Intrigued by the extra murder weapon, a poison chalice, they decided to incorporate it into their detective roleplay.\n\nThat evening, the hotel hosted a grand event featuring a performance by the renowned US singer and musician, Leather Tuscadero. Among the guests was the female alter-ego of Turner Prize winner Grayson Perry, who was mesmerized by the performance.\n\nDuring the event, the Princess and the Frog overheard a conversation about the reign of Richard III, who was king of England for only two years. The discussion led to a debate about the British superstition, \"Marry in May, and you'll live to rue the day.\" The Princess and the Frog found the superstition quite amusing and decided to investigate its origins.\n\nAs their day of detective work came to an end, the Princess, the Frog, Engie Benjy, and their new friends gathered in the hotel's grand hall. They listened to the enchanting sound of the heaviest swinging bell in England, which was housed in the hotel's cathedral. The beautiful melody brought them all together, creating a bond that would last a lifetime. And so, the Princess and the Frog continued their adventures, making new friends and memories along the way."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 2, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["The famous Badnutt\u2019s Palace Hotel is in which European winter resort?", "In which 1993 film does Nicholas Cage play drifter Michael Williams who is mistaken for a hitman?", "Which famous UK television duo provide the voices for the main characters in the children\u2019s program \u2018Engie Benjy\u2019?", "Giugno is Italian for which month of the year?", "What is the extra murder weapon in the 1999 50th Anniversary Cluedo game?", "Which US singer/musician played Leather Tuscadero in the television show \u2018Happy Days\u2019?", "What is the name of the female alter-ego of Turner Prize winner Grayson perry?", "For how many years was Richard III king of England?", "According to British superstition, \u2018Marry in \u2018when\u2019 and you\u2019ll live to rue the day\u2019?", "The heaviest swinging bell in England is in which cathedral?"], "answers": [["St. Moritz (Graub\u00fcnden)", "Saint Moritz", "San Moritz", "San Murezzan", "St.-Moritz", "St. Moritz GR", "St. Moritz", "St-Moritz", "St.Moritz", "St Moritz", "Sankt-Moritz", "Saint-Moritz", "Sankt Moritz", "St. Moritz (Graubuenden)", "St. Moritz, Switzerland", "St. Mortitz", "St. Moritz (Grisons)", "St. Moritz (Graubunden)", "st moritz switzerland", "st moritz grisons", "san moritz", "st moritz", "st moritz graub\u00fcnden", "st moritz graubuenden", "saint moritz", "sankt moritz", "st moritz graubunden", "st mortitz", "san murezzan", "st moritz gr"], ["Red Rock West", "red rock west"], ["Declan Donnely", "Ant & dec", "PJ and Duncan", "Ant and dec", "Ant & Dec", "PJ & Duncan AKA", "Ant And Dec", "Ant dec", "Anton Deck", "PJ & Duncan", "Ant and Dec", "ant and dec", "pj duncan", "anton deck", "pj duncan aka", "pj and duncan", "declan donnely", "ant dec"], ["\u32c5", "Jun.", "JUNE", "June 31", "June", "Junes", "Juno (German)", "June 31st", "june", "jun", "\u32c5", "june 31", "junes", "june 31st", "juno german"], ["Bottle of poison", "bottle of poison"], ["Suzie Quatro", "Suzi Q.", "Suzi Quattro", "Suzy Quatro", "Susie Quattro", "Susie Quatro", "Suzie Quattro", "Unreleased Emotion", "Suzy Quattro", "Suzi Quatro", "suzie quatro", "susie quatro", "suzi quatro", "suzy quatro", "unreleased emotion", "suzy quattro", "suzie quattro", "suzi quattro", "susie quattro", "suzi q"], ["Clair", "Clair (disambiguation)", "Claire", "Claire (disambiguation)", "clair disambiguation", "clair", "claire", "claire disambiguation"], ["2", "Two", "two", "2", "two"], ["\u32c4", "May sickness", "May", "Veliki traven", "May (month)", "Month May", "month may", "veliki traven", "may month", "may sickness", "\u32c4", "may"], ["St. Paul's Churchyard", "London Cathedral", "St Paul's Churchyard", "Saint Paul's Cathedral, London", "Great Paul", "St. Paul's Cathedral, London", "St Paul's Cathedral", "Saint Paul's Cathedral", "St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral", "St pauls cathedral", "St. Pauls Cathedral", "St.Paul's Cathedral", "St. Paul's Cathedral", "St Pauls Cathedral", "Saint-Paul's Cathedral", "St Paul\u2019s Cathedral", "Cathedral Church of St Paul", "St Paul's Cathedral, London", "Saint Paul's Cathedral (London)", "St Paul's cathedral", "St. Paul's cathedral", "cathedral church of st paul", "st paul s cathedral london", "st paul s cathedral", "saint paul s cathedral", "london cathedral", "st paul s churchyard", "great paul", "saint paul s cathedral london", "st pauls cathedral"]], "question_ids": ["qb_6250", "qb_6257", "qb_6284", "qb_6288", "qb_6323", "qb_6330", "qb_6337", "qb_6356", "qb_6386", "qb_6395"], "topic": "Princess and the Frog"}}

As she ascended the mountain, she encountered a skink, a type of reptile she had never seen before.\n\nWhile exploring the mountain, Pocahontas stumbled upon the characters from the 1960s television series 'Lost in Space'. They informed her that they were set in the year 1997, which seemed like a distant future to Pocahontas.\n\nDuring her journey, Pocahontas met the Dalai Lama, who presented her with a personalized Bradford City FC shirt. The shirt had the number 14 on the back, which she wore with pride.\n\nTowards the end of her adventure, Pocahontas had the opportunity to meet the children of a former US President. She was introduced to Michael, John, Steven, and Susan, the children of President Lyndon B. Johnson. They shared stories of their father's time in office and the impact he had on their country.\n\nPocahontas returned to her people with newfound knowledge and experiences, grateful for the opportunity to learn about different cultures and the world beyond her homeland."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["For how many years did English monarch King Henry III reign?", "What colour is Lady Penelope\u2019s car in the television puppet series \u2018Thunderbirds\u2019?", "Which chain of European retailers began with a store near a crossroads in Annecy, France in 1958?", "In the 1965 film \u2018Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines\u2019, how much is the prize money, in pounds sterling, for the fastest flight from London to Paris?", "Who directed the 1969 film \u2018Women in Love\u2019, starring Oliver Reed and Glenda Jackson?", "Mount Entoto is the highest peak overlooking which African capital city?", "A skink is what type of reptile?", "The 1960\u2019s television series \u2018Lost in Space\u2019 is set in which year?", "In 2012, Bradford City FC presented the Dalai Lama with a personalised club shirt with which number on the back?", "Michael, John, Steven and Susan are the children of which former US President?"], "answers": [["56", "fifty-six", "fifty six", "56"], ["Pink", "Pink the colour", "Momoiro", "Tamarisk (color)", "Neon pink", "Pastel pink", "FFD1DC", "Pinkest", "Lightish Red", "Pinkishness", "Light red", "Kinky pink", "Pinkness", "Tamarisk (colour)", "Pinkishly", "Pastel Pink", "FADADD", "Pink (color)", "Pinkly", "ffd1dc", "tamarisk colour", "pinkishly", "fadadd", "lightish red", "pinkly", "pinkishness", "kinky pink", "tamarisk color", "pink colour", "pinkest", "pastel pink", "pinkness", "neon pink", "pink color", "pink", "light red", "momoiro"], ["1Mobile", "Carrefour", "Carrefour Japan", "Carredour", "Carrefour Group", "Carrefour SA", "Carrefur", "Carrefour (company)", "Carefour", "Pryca", "Carrefour S.A.", "carrefour sa", "carrefour company", "carrefur", "1mobile", "carrefour", "carrefour japan", "carrefour group", "carredour", "carrefour s", "pryca", "carefour"], ["10,000", "10000", "ten thousand", "10000", "10 000", "ten thousand"], ["Henry Kenneth Russell", "Henry Kenneth Alfred Russell", "Henry Kenneth Alfred %22Ken%22 Russell", "Ken Russell", "Ken Russel", "henry kenneth russell", "henry kenneth alfred russell", "ken russel", "henry kenneth alfred 22ken 22 russell", "ken russell"], ["Ethiopian Natural History Museum", "Adis Abeba", "Addis Ababa, ET", "\u0100dd\u012bs \u0100beb\u0101", "\u0100d\u012bs \u0100beba", "Addis Abba, Ethiopia", "Addis Abba", "Tewodros Square", "Addis Abeba", "Addis Ababa Museum", "\u12a0\u12f2\u1235 \u12a0\u1260\u1263", "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia", "Capital of Ethiopia", "Ethiopian Ethnological Museum", "Addis Ababa", "Addis-Abeba", "New flower", "Addis Adaba", "Districts of Addis Ababa", "Adis Ababa", "The Grand Anwar Mosque (Addis Ababa)", "Adis abeda", "Finfinne", "adis abeba", "ethiopian natural history museum", "addis adaba", "grand anwar mosque addis ababa", "capital of ethiopia", "ethiopian ethnological museum", "addis ababa ethiopia", "districts of addis ababa", "\u12a0\u12f2\u1235 \u12a0\u1260\u1263", "addis ababa", "\u0101d\u012bs \u0101beba", "addis abba ethiopia", "adis abeda", "\u0101dd\u012bs \u0101beb\u0101", "addis abba", "addis ababa et", "finfinne", "tewodros square", "addis ababa museum", "new flower", "addis abeba", "adis ababa"], ["Lacertilian", "Lizards in captivity", "Lizards", "Lacertians", "Spotted lizard", "Lacertia", "Lacertilia", "Lizard", "Lacertian", "List of Lizards", "Lacertids", "Chipkali", "lacertilian", "lacertians", "lacertia", "lacertilia", "lacertids", "chipkali", "lizard", "lizards in captivity", "list of lizards", "spotted lizard", "lizards", "lacertian"], ["one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven", "1997", "one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven", "1997"], ["fourteen", "14", "fourteen", "14"], ["President Gerald R.

Bambi learns valuable lessons from his encounters and returns home.\n\nStory:\nOnce upon a time, in a beautiful forest filled with trees of various shades, including the rich brown hue of Bole, lived a young deer named Bambi. One day, Bambi decided to explore the forest and meet new friends.\n\nAs he wandered, Bambi came across a duo of animals named Jimmy and David, who were named after the writers of the UK television series 'Dad's Army.' They were a comedic pair, always making Bambi laugh with their witty banter.\n\nFurther into the forest, Bambi encountered a Muppet-like creature named Wilson, who shared a name with a former US President. Wilson was wise and knowledgeable, and he told Bambi about the history of the 'asylums' in Britain, which were slave laundries from the 18th to late 20th centuries, ostensibly to house 'fallen women.'\n\nWhile playing with Wilson, Bambi accidentally injured his 'Boat Race,' which was Cockney rhyming slang for his face. In pain, Bambi sought help from a sterlet, a type of sturgeon fish, who lived in a nearby river.\n\nThe sterlet introduced Bambi to Nurse Ratched, a character from the 1975 film 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.' Her first name was Mildred, and she was known for her stern demeanor.

One day, Bambi decided to explore the forest and meet new friends.\n\nAs he wandered, Bambi came across a duo of animals named Jimmy and David, who were named after the writers of the UK television series 'Dad's Army.' They were a comedic pair, always making Bambi laugh with their witty banter.\n\nFurther into the forest, Bambi encountered a Muppet-like creature named Wilson, who shared a name with a former US President. Wilson was wise and knowledgeable, and he told Bambi about the history of the 'asylums' in Britain, which were slave laundries from the 18th to late 20th centuries, ostensibly to house 'fallen women.'\n\nWhile playing with Wilson, Bambi accidentally injured his 'Boat Race,' which was Cockney rhyming slang for his face. In pain, Bambi sought help from a sterlet, a type of sturgeon fish, who lived in a nearby river.\n\nThe sterlet introduced Bambi to Nurse Ratched, a character from the 1975 film 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.' Her first name was Mildred, and she was known for her stern demeanor. Nurse Ratched tended to Bambi's injury and told him about the world's first teletext information service, which was a fascinating piece of history.\n\nAs Bambi continued his journey, he met an animal named Peter, who was named after the British actor who wrote the 1993 autobiography 'Loitering With Intent.'
