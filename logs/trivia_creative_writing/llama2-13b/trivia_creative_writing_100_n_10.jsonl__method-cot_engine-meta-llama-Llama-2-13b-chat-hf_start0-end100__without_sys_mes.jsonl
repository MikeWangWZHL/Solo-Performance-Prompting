He quickly scanned the area with his spider-sense, looking for any weaknesses or vulnerabilities that he could exploit.\n\nJust as he was about to make his move, he heard a voice behind him. \"Hey, you're that Spider-Man guy, aren't you?\" It was Joey Richardson, the son of Vanessa Redgrave, who was standing on the roof of the bank with a tennis racket in hand. \"My mom's been kidnapped by these guys, and I need your help to get her back.\"\n\nSpider-Man was taken aback by the sudden request, but he knew he couldn't just stand there and do nothing.

But one man stood tall against the chaos: Batman. With his trusty Batmobile and his sharp mind, he was the only hope for the citizens of Gotham.\n\nOne night, as Batman was patrolling the streets, he received a call from the Gotham City Police Department. They had received a tip that the Joker was hiding in an abandoned shipyard on the outskirts of the city. Batman quickly made his way to the shipyard, his heart pounding with anticipation.\n\nAs he entered the shipyard, he noticed something strange. There were rows of baby strollers lined up against the walls, each one filled with sleeping infants. Batman's eyes widened as he realized that the Joker must have been using the shipyard as a hideout for his henchmen. But why the baby strollers?\n\nSuddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was the Joker, grinning maniacally as he held a baby bottle in one hand and a gun in the other. \"Ah, Batman,\" he cackled. \"I've been waiting for you.\"\n\nBut Batman was ready. He had been using the baby strollers to his advantage, using them to sneak up on the Joker's henchmen and take them down one by one. And now, with the Joker in his sights, he was ready to put an end to the chaos once and for all.\n\n\"If I can't beat this bum, take my name off the record books,\" the Joker taunted, as he fired his gun at Batman. But Batman was too quick, dodging the bullet and countering with a powerful punch that sent the Joker flying into a stack of crates.\n\nThe Joker groaned as he struggled to get to his feet, but Batman was already on top of him, his fists clenched and ready to deliver the final blow. \"It's over, Joker,\" he growled. \"Your reign of terror is over.\"\n\nThe Joker looked up at Batman with a twisted grin. \"You may have won this time, Batman,\" he said. \"But I'll be back. And next time, you won't be so lucky.\"\n\nBatman just smiled, his eyes glinting with determination. \"I'm always ready for you, Joker,\" he said. \"You can never beat me.\"\n\nAnd with that, the Joker was hauled away, defeated once again by the caped crusader.

With his trusty Batmobile and his sharp mind, he was the only hope for the citizens of Gotham.\n\nOne night, as Batman was patrolling the streets, he received a call from the Gotham City Police Department. They had received a tip that the Joker was hiding in an abandoned shipyard on the outskirts of the city. Batman quickly made his way to the shipyard, his heart pounding with anticipation.\n\nAs he entered the shipyard, he noticed something strange. There were rows of baby strollers lined up against the walls, each one filled with sleeping infants. Batman's eyes widened as he realized that the Joker must have been using the shipyard as a hideout for his henchmen. But why the baby strollers?\n\nSuddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was the Joker, grinning maniacally as he held a baby bottle in one hand and a gun in the other. \"Ah, Batman,\" he cackled. \"I've been waiting for you.\"\n\nBut Batman was ready. He had been using the baby strollers to his advantage, using them to sneak up on the Joker's henchmen and take them down one by one. And now, with the Joker in his sights, he was ready to put an end to the chaos once and for all.\n\n\"If I can't beat this bum, take my name off the record books,\" the Joker taunted, as he fired his gun at Batman. But Batman was too quick, dodging the bullet and countering with a powerful punch that sent the Joker flying into a stack of crates.\n\nThe Joker groaned as he struggled to get to his feet, but Batman was already on top of him, his fists clenched and ready to deliver the final blow. \"It's over, Joker,\" he growled. \"Your reign of terror is over.\"\n\nThe Joker looked up at Batman with a twisted grin. \"You may have won this time, Batman,\" he said. \"But I'll be back. And next time, you won't be so lucky.\"\n\nBatman just smiled, his eyes glinting with determination. \"I'm always ready for you, Joker,\" he said. \"You can never beat me.\"\n\nAnd with that, the Joker was hauled away, defeated once again by the caped crusader. Batman had saved Gotham City once more, and he would continue to do so, no matter what dangers lay ahead."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 0,

The golf balls were a vibrant shade of pink, and they were used by all the golfers who dared to venture onto the frozen fairways.\n\nOne day, a young lion named Simba, who was on a quest to become the greatest golfer in the land, stumbled upon a hidden stash of golf balls in the heart of the course.

As he teed off, he felt a strange sensation, as if the golf balls were imbuing him with the spirit of Chuck Berry himself.

The only sound was the soft crunch of the snow under his paws and the distant howling of the wind. It was as if the entire city was holding its breath, waiting for him to make his next move.\n\nJust as Simba was about to finish his game, he heard a voice behind him. \"Well done, young lion,\" the voice said. \"You have the heart of a true golfer.\" Simba turned to see Michael Jackson's second wife, Lisa Marie Presley, standing behind him, a smile on her face.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Simba replied, his voice shaking with excitement. \"But who are you?\"\n\n\"I am the queen of this frozen kingdom,\" Lisa Marie replied. \"And I have been watching you, Simba.

He took a deep breath and swung his club, sending the vintage golf ball soaring through the air. It landed with a soft thud in the hole, and Simba let out a triumphant roar.\n\n\"To err is human, but it feels divine,\" Lisa Marie said, quoting the famous philosopher, as she placed a crown on Simba's head. \"You are the new king of Antarctica's golf course.\"\n\nSimba looked out at the city, now bathed in a warm, golden light.

For example, Mr. Incredible used addition to add more stretch to his body, Elastigirl used subtraction to subtract the machine's laser beams, Violet used multiplication to multiply her force fields, Dash used division to divide the machine's attacks, and Jack-Jack used division to divide the machine's attacks.\n\nThe Incredibles also learned about the fastest animal on two legs, which was the cheetah, and the mammal that constructs a lodge in which to store food, rear young, and pass the winter, which was the beaver.

Marlin learned that the mineral was calcium carbonate.\n\nAs they continued their journey, they encountered a group of starfish who were discussing the brightest star in the sky. Marlin learned that the brightest star is Sirius, and that it is orbited by a planet called the Pup.\n\nFinally, they encountered a group of fish who were discussing the three primary colours of light. Marlin learned that the three primary colours of light are red, blue, and green.\n\nAs they approached the dentist's office, Marlin realized that the answer to the last question, the second lightest chemical element, was nitrogen.

Meanwhile, in the real world, Peter Simple, Jack Horner, and Ben Nevis had just won the decathlon at the Olympic Games. The witch, determined to use their athletic prowess for her own gain, cast a spell that transported them to the Land of Oz.\n\nUpon their arrival, they found themselves in the middle of a bustling marketplace, where they were greeted by a group of munchkins. The munchkins were overjoyed to see the three athletes and begged them to help them win the annual decathlon against the Wicked Witch's team. The witch, it seemed, had purchased Chelsea football club for \u00a31 in 1982 and was determined to use her newfound power to dominate the sporting world.\n\nThe three athletes, eager for a new challenge, agreed to compete in the decathlon. As they prepared for the event, they couldn't help but notice the strange looks they were getting from the locals. It wasn't until they saw the director of the film Titanic, James Cameron, walking by with a giant Oscar statue that they realized why. Cameron had just won the award for Best Director and, in his acceptance speech, had declared himself \"king of the world.\"\n\nAs the decathlon began, the three athletes found themselves facing off against a team of witches and wizards, including the infamous Vincent Van Gogh, who had painted some of the most iconic works of art in the land of Oz. The competition was fierce, but the three athletes were determined to win.\n\nJust as they were about to take the field for the final event, a massive earthquake struck the land of Oz. The ground shook and trembled, and the athletes were thrown off balance. When the dust settled, they found themselves face to face with a giant gerbil, who introduced himself as Roland Rat's pet, Bungle.\n\nBungle explained that he had been sent by the Wicked Witch to distract the athletes and ensure their defeat. But, as the three athletes looked into Bungle's eyes, they saw something unexpected - a deep sadness and longing. It seemed that Bungle was not just a mindless minion, but a living, breathing creature with his own desires and dreams.\n\nMoved by Bungle's plight, the athletes decided to join forces with him and the munchkins to defeat the Wicked Witch and her team. Together, they fought bravely, using their athletic prowess and cunning to outmaneuver the witches and wizards.\n\nIn the end, they emerged victorious, and the Wicked Witch was banished from the land of Oz forever. As the athletes prepared to return to their own world, they were greeted by a surprise - they had been transported to a strange, unfamiliar place, where they found themselves face to face with a giant, talking egg.\n\nThe egg, it turned out, was the product of a rare and mysterious animal, known for its incredibly long gestation period of around 22 months. The animal, a giant tortoise, had been the subject of a heated debate among the scientists of Oz, who were trying to determine the father of the egg.\n\nAs the athletes watched in amazement, the egg began to crack and shake, and a tiny, adorable baby tortoise emerged. The baby tortoise, it turned out, was the product of a secret romance between the Wicked Witch and a famous celebrity, who had denied paternity until a DNA test proved otherwise.\n\nThe athletes, still reeling from the shock of it all, were suddenly transported back to their own world, where they found themselves standing in front of a giant, glittering portal. As they stepped through the portal, they found themselves back in the real world, but with a newfound appreciation for the magic and wonder of the Land of Oz."}}], "usage": {}, "prompt": "Write a short and coherent story about Wizard of Oz that incorporates the answers to the following 10 questions: What is the final event in a decathlon?

Cameron had just won the award for Best Director and, in his acceptance speech, had declared himself \"king of the world.\"\n\nAs the decathlon began, the three athletes found themselves facing off against a team of witches and wizards, including the infamous Vincent Van Gogh, who had painted some of the most iconic works of art in the land of Oz. The competition was fierce, but the three athletes were determined to win.\n\nJust as they were about to take the field for the final event, a massive earthquake struck the land of Oz. The ground shook and trembled, and the athletes were thrown off balance. When the dust settled, they found themselves face to face with a giant gerbil, who introduced himself as Roland Rat's pet, Bungle.\n\nBungle explained that he had been sent by the Wicked Witch to distract the athletes and ensure their defeat. But, as the three athletes looked into Bungle's eyes, they saw something unexpected - a deep sadness and longing. It seemed that Bungle was not just a mindless minion, but a living, breathing creature with his own desires and dreams.\n\nMoved by Bungle's plight, the athletes decided to join forces with him and the munchkins to defeat the Wicked Witch and her team. Together, they fought bravely, using their athletic prowess and cunning to outmaneuver the witches and wizards.\n\nIn the end, they emerged victorious, and the Wicked Witch was banished from the land of Oz forever. As the athletes prepared to return to their own world, they were greeted by a surprise - they had been transported to a strange, unfamiliar place, where they found themselves face to face with a giant, talking egg.\n\nThe egg, it turned out, was the product of a rare and mysterious animal, known for its incredibly long gestation period of around 22 months. The animal, a giant tortoise, had been the subject of a heated debate among the scientists of Oz, who were trying to determine the father of the egg.\n\nAs the athletes watched in amazement, the egg began to crack and shake, and a tiny, adorable baby tortoise emerged. The baby tortoise, it turned out, was the product of a secret romance between the Wicked Witch and a famous celebrity, who had denied paternity until a DNA test proved otherwise.\n\nThe athletes, still reeling from the shock of it all, were suddenly transported back to their own world, where they found themselves standing in front of a giant, glittering portal. As they stepped through the portal, they found themselves back in the real world, but with a newfound appreciation for the magic and wonder of the Land of Oz."], "parsing_success_flag": [true],

Answer the first question and move on to the second question.\n4. Repeat this pattern until all 10 questions have been answered.\n5. End the story with a conclusion that ties all the answers together.\n\nStory:\n\nOnce upon a time, in the city of Townsville, there lived three super-powered sisters, Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, known as the Powerpuff Girls. They were always ready to save the day from any evil that came their way.\n\nOne sunny day, while they were out on a patrol, they received a distress call from the mayor of Townsville. A Cuba Libre, a powerful cocktail made with rum, cola, and lime, was causing chaos in the city. The mayor asked the Powerpuff Girls to stop the Cuba Libre before it destroyed the city.\n\nThe Powerpuff Girls flew to the source of the chaos and found a group of rowdy partygoers, led by a man named Victor Krum, who were drinking the Cuba Libre and causing trouble. Blossom used her powers to create a force field to contain the chaos, while Bubbles used her powers to create a soothing rain to calm the partygoers down. Buttercup, being the toughest of the three, used her powers to defeat Victor Krum and his wand, which was made by none other than Firenze, a talented wand-maker.\n\nAs they were dealing with the situation, they noticed a building in the distance that looked familiar.

They were always ready to save the day from any evil that came their way.\n\nOne sunny day, while they were out on a patrol, they received a distress call from the mayor of Townsville. A Cuba Libre, a powerful cocktail made with rum, cola, and lime, was causing chaos in the city. The mayor asked the Powerpuff Girls to stop the Cuba Libre before it destroyed the city.\n\nThe Powerpuff Girls flew to the source of the chaos and found a group of rowdy partygoers, led by a man named Victor Krum, who were drinking the Cuba Libre and causing trouble. Blossom used her powers to create a force field to contain the chaos, while Bubbles used her powers to create a soothing rain to calm the partygoers down. Buttercup, being the toughest of the three, used her powers to defeat Victor Krum and his wand, which was made by none other than Firenze, a talented wand-maker.\n\nAs they were dealing with the situation, they noticed a building in the distance that looked familiar. It was the Rosslyn Chapel, said to house the Holy Grail and featured prominently at the end of The Da Vinci Code. They decided to investigate and found a hidden room inside the chapel that contained the Grail.\n\nJust then, they received another distress call from the mayor, this time about a men's singles tennis match at Wimbledon.

Make sure the story is engaging, fun, and includes the Wild Thornberrys' signature humor and adventure.\n\nStory:\n\nThe Wild Thornberrys were on another exciting adventure, traveling through the African savannah in their trusty safari vehicle. Eliza, the family's youngest member, was busy filming a documentary about the different animals they encountered, while her older sisters, Debbie and Lily, were busy trying to get the perfect shot of a pride of lions.\n\nAs they were driving, they came across a group of monkeys playing in the trees. \"Hey, look over there!\" exclaimed Debbie, \"those monkeys are playing with a map!\"\n\n\"Wow, that looks like the map we've been looking for!\" said Lily. \"It's the map of the Red Sea, and it's connected to the Indian Ocean by the Gulf of Aden.\"\n\n\"That's right!\" exclaimed Eliza, \"I learned that in school. The Red Sea is a very important waterway that connects Europe, Asia, and Africa.\"\n\nJust then, a voice spoke to them from behind. \"Hello there, Wild Thornberrys!

Conclusion\n\nStory:\n\nThe Sandlot was a magical place where kids could escape the troubles of the world and just be kids. One summer, a group of friends stumbled upon an old, mysterious book hidden away in the sand. As they flipped through its yellowed pages, they discovered that it was a diary written by a British monarch who had famously said, \"I don't wish to open windows into men's souls.\"\n\nThe friends were fascinated by the story of the monarch, who had ruled with wisdom and compassion, but had also been known for his love of the Sandlot. As they read on, they learned that the monarch had played a game of baseball with the local children every summer, and had even built a special sandlot for them to play on.\n\nAs they continued to read, they came across a passage about the monarch's favorite singer, who had played the role of Jareth the Goblin King in the 1986 film 'Labyrinth.' The singer had been known for his powerful voice and captivating stage presence, and the monarch had been a huge fan.\n\nThe friends were amazed by the connections they were making between the past and the present, and they couldn't wait to see what other secrets the book held. As they turned the page, they saw a picture of a South African civil rights leader, who had fought tirelessly against apartheid and had been a close friend of the monarch.\n\nThe friends were intrigued by the story of the leader, who had been a powerful force for change in his country, and they wondered if there was a connection between his work and the Sandlot. As they read on, they discovered that the leader had often visited the Sandlot as a child, and had found solace and inspiration in the game of baseball.\n\nAs they continued to read, they came across a passage about a British actress who had played the role of Valerie in the 1997 film 'Nil By Mouth.' The actress had been known for her powerful performances and her dedication to her craft, and the monarch had been a huge fan of her work.\n\nThe friends were amazed by the connections they were making between the past and the present, and they couldn't wait to see what other secrets the book held. As they turned the page, they saw a picture of a Brazilian player who had won the Women's Singles Finals at Wimbledon in 1959, 1960, and 1964.\n\nThe friends were impressed by the player's achievements, and they wondered if there was a connection between her success and the Sandlot.

One summer, a group of friends stumbled upon an old, mysterious book hidden away in the sand. As they flipped through its yellowed pages, they discovered that it was a diary written by a British monarch who had famously said, \"I don't wish to open windows into men's souls.\"\n\nThe friends were fascinated by the story of the monarch, who had ruled with wisdom and compassion, but had also been known for his love of the Sandlot. As they read on, they learned that the monarch had played a game of baseball with the local children every summer, and had even built a special sandlot for them to play on.\n\nAs they continued to read, they came across a passage about the monarch's favorite singer, who had played the role of Jareth the Goblin King in the 1986 film 'Labyrinth.' The singer had been known for his powerful voice and captivating stage presence, and the monarch had been a huge fan.\n\nThe friends were amazed by the connections they were making between the past and the present, and they couldn't wait to see what other secrets the book held.

She was a kind and gentle creature, with a heart full of love and a smile that could light up the darkest of days.\n\nOne day, while out on a walk, Rainbow Brite stumbled upon a mysterious and intriguing object - a Persian slipper, with a note hidden inside. The note was from the famous detective Sherlock Holmes, who had been searching for a missing treasure for years.\n\nAs Rainbow Brite read the note, she realized that the treasure was hidden in the toe of the slipper, and that only the cleverest and most imaginative of creatures could find it. She knew just the creatures to ask for help - the mischievous and playful creatures of Wonderland, who were always up for an adventure.\n\nRainbow Brite set off on a journey to Wonderland, where she met the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the March Hare. Together, they played a game of croquet, using fluffy creatures as balls and hoops made of rainbow-colored flowers.\n\nAs they played, Rainbow Brite noticed that the Cheshire Cat was wearing a pair of brown boots, which reminded her of the Belgian beer 'Kriek', flavored with delicious cherries. She asked the Cat if he had ever tried it, and he replied that he had, and that it was his favorite drink.\n\nAs they continued their adventure, they came across the Jewry Wall Museum in the British city of Leicester, where they learned about the history of the Jewish community in the city. Rainbow Brite was fascinated by the stories of courage and perseverance, and she knew that she had found her treasure.\n\nBut, just as they were about to leave, they were approached by a mysterious figure - the actor who had succeeded Marlon Brando as the head of the Corleone family in the Godfather films. He offered to help them find the treasure, but Rainbow Brite knew that she could trust only her own imagination and the creatures of Wonderland.\n\nTogether, they searched high and low, until they finally found the treasure - a small, delicate bottle of 'Parfait d'Amour', a liqueur with a sweet and tangy flavor, and a color that matched Rainbow Brite's own rainbow-colored hair.\n\nAs they celebrated their victory, Rainbow Brite realized that the treasure was not just the liqueur, but the friends she had made along the way - the creatures of Wonderland, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the March Hare.

She was a kind and gentle creature, with a heart full of love and a smile that could light up the darkest of days.\n\nOne day, while out on a walk, Rainbow Brite stumbled upon a mysterious and intriguing object - a Persian slipper, with a note hidden inside. The note was from the famous detective Sherlock Holmes, who had been searching for a missing treasure for years.\n\nAs Rainbow Brite read the note, she realized that the treasure was hidden in the toe of the slipper, and that only the cleverest and most imaginative of creatures could find it. She knew just the creatures to ask for help - the mischievous and playful creatures of Wonderland, who were always up for an adventure.\n\nRainbow Brite set off on a journey to Wonderland, where she met the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the March Hare. Together, they played a game of croquet, using fluffy creatures as balls and hoops made of rainbow-colored flowers.\n\nAs they played, Rainbow Brite noticed that the Cheshire Cat was wearing a pair of brown boots, which reminded her of the Belgian beer 'Kriek', flavored with delicious cherries. She asked the Cat if he had ever tried it, and he replied that he had, and that it was his favorite drink.\n\nAs they continued their adventure, they came across the Jewry Wall Museum in the British city of Leicester, where they learned about the history of the Jewish community in the city. Rainbow Brite was fascinated by the stories of courage and perseverance, and she knew that she had found her treasure.\n\nBut, just as they were about to leave, they were approached by a mysterious figure - the actor who had succeeded Marlon Brando as the head of the Corleone family in the Godfather films. He offered to help them find the treasure, but Rainbow Brite knew that she could trust only her own imagination and the creatures of Wonderland.\n\nTogether, they searched high and low, until they finally found the treasure - a small, delicate bottle of 'Parfait d'Amour', a liqueur with a sweet and tangy flavor, and a color that matched Rainbow Brite's own rainbow-colored hair.\n\nAs they celebrated their victory, Rainbow Brite realized that the treasure was not just the liqueur, but the friends she had made along the way - the creatures of Wonderland, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the March Hare.

They knew just how to inflict the most pain on their enemies, and they fought with all their might.\n\nIn the end, the Autobots emerged victorious, and the Decepticons retreated. As they celebrated their victory, Optimus Prime mentioned that there were 4 imperial gallons in a firkin. Mrs. Potato Head nodded in agreement, remembering a time when she had used a firkin to measure out flour for a baking project.\n\nAnd so, the Autobots and the Potato Heads continued to play

As a child, she was teased by other animals for her large eyes, leading to her developing the fear. However, she overcame her fear by befriending a shy and timid yona named Yvette. Yvette had also been teased for her large eyes, but she had learned to embrace them and see their beauty.\n\nFluffy's encounter with the patient led her to recall her time at the Zootopia Police Academy, where she met Inspector Bucket, a character from a Charles Dickens novel. Inspector Bucket had been investigating a missing camel with two humps, and Fluffy had helped him solve the case.\n\nAs Fluffy and Inspector Bucket teamed up to solve the current case, they discovered that the ommatophobia-related incidents were being caused by a group of animals who were protesting the lack of representation of their species in Zootopia's government. The protesters believed that the large eyes of the predators in power were a symbol of their oppression, and they were demanding equal representation and rights.\n\nFluffy and Inspector Bucket must use their skills and knowledge to uncover the truth behind the protests and bring the perpetrators to justice. They encountered many challenges along the way, but their friendship and determination ultimately led to a successful resolution of the case.\n\nIn the end, Fluffy realized that her own experiences with ommatophobia had given her a unique perspective on the case, and she was proud to have played a role in bringing about justice and equality for all animals in Zootopia."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 2, "question_count": 10}], "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "model_type": "llama2", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "llama_config": {"task": "text-generation", "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "torch_dtype": "torch.float16", "device_map": "auto", "do_sample": false}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In medicine, pyrosis is the technical term for which condition?", "Shashlik is what type of food dish?", "Psychoanalyst A A Brill described what as \u2018Torches of Freedom\u2019 in the 1920\u2019s, as symbols of equality for women?", "In the novel \u2018Watership Down\u2019, Yona is what type of creature?", "Who became leader of the British Conservative Party in July 1965?", "What type of camel has two humps?", "Ommatophobia is the irrational fear of which part of the body?", "Inspector Bucket is a character in which novel by Charles Dickens?", "Who played factory boss Danny Baldwin in the British television soap \u2018Coronation Street\u2019?", "Maria Dickin was the founder of which British animal charity in 1917?"], "answers": [["Cardiac passion", "Acid indigestion", "Cardiacus dolor", "Heartburn", "Cardialgia", "Heart burn", "Agita", "Functional heartburn", "Cardialgy", "Ardor ventriculi", "cardialgia", "cardiacus dolor", "heart burn", "cardiac passion", "agita", "heartburn", "acid indigestion", "ardor ventriculi", "cardialgy", "functional heartburn"], ["Chenjeh Kebab", "Kebob", "Chapli kebab", "Testi Kebab", "Kakori Kebab", "Burrah Kebab", "Kababs", "Shish-kebab", "Kalmi Kebab", "Sultan's Feast", "Kalmi", "Kebabs", "Shish kebob", "Shishkabob", "Shishkebab", "Chapli Kebab", "Kabab", "Kabab Bakhtiari", "Qabab", "Kalmi kebab", "Kebab Kenjeh \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u0646\u062c\u0647", "Chelow Kebab", "Testi", "Iranian kabab", "Kabob", "Burrah", "Kabaab", "Bihari kebab", "Chapli kabab", "Sheesh kebab", "Steam kebab", "Shish kabob", "Shish-kabob", "Kebab", "Galouti", "Kebap", "Chapli Kabab", "Galouti Kebab", "Kebab restaurant", "shish kebob", "kebab kenjeh \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u0646\u062c\u0647", "kebob", "chapli kabab", "shish kabob", "kakori kebab", "kebab", "burrah", "steam kebab", "sultan s feast", "bihari kebab", "galouti kebab", "kababs", "kabab bakhtiari", "iranian kabab", "kabab", "kebabs", "sheesh kebab", "chapli kebab", "chenjeh kebab", "testi kebab", "kebap", "shish kebab", "kabob", "kalmi kebab", "kalmi", "testi", "shishkebab", "kebab restaurant", "burrah kebab", "galouti", "qabab", "chelow kebab", "shishkabob", "kabaab"], ["Ccigarette", "Cigarrette", "Cigarette butts", "Cigaretes", "Cciggarete", "European cigarettes", "Full flavor (cigarette type)", "Sickarette", "Full flavored cigarettes", "Ciggie", "Cigarette end", "Cigarete", "Cigerette", "Ciggy", "100mm cigarette", "Cigarette", "Fag (cigarette)", "Full Flavor (cigarette type)", "Cigarette tube", "Lung rocket", "Cigarrete", "Cigaret", "Cig", "Coffin Nail", "Cigarette litter", "Smokes", "Cigarettes", "Cancer stick", "Cigs", "Cancer Stick", "Cigarette ash", "Loosey", "Ciggarette", "Tobacco cigarette", "Cigerettes", "Dog end", "Cigarette butt", "ciggy", "loosey", "cigarrete", "cigarettes", "cigarette litter", "lung rocket", "ccigarette", "smokes", "cigerette", "ciggarette", "ciggie", "fag cigarette", "cigs", "full flavored cigarettes", "cigarete", "cigaretes", "european cigarettes", "dog end", "cigarette", "cigarette tube", "cigarette butts", "cigerettes", "cigarette butt", "100mm cigarette", "cigaret", "coffin nail", "cigarette ash", "cigarette end", "sickarette", "tobacco cigarette", "cciggarete", "full flavor cigarette type", "cig", "cigarrette", "cancer stick"], ["Domestic Hedgehog", "Hedgepig", "Erinaceinae", "Hedge hog", "Hedge Hog", "Hedgehogs", "Hedgehog", "hedgepig", "domestic hedgehog", "hedgehogs", "erinaceinae", "hedge hog", "hedgehog"], ["Sir Edward Heath", "Shadow Cabinet of Edward Heath II", "Shadow Cabinet of Edward Heath (1974\u20131975)", "Edward Heath", "Edward Richard George Heath", "Ted Heath", "Edward R.

One day, while wandering through the forest, they stumbled upon a strange and mysterious object \u2013 a bottle of absinthe.\n\nThe trolls had never seen anything like it before, and they were immediately intrigued. They gathered around the bottle, marveling at its greenish-yellow color and the strange, herbal aroma that wafted from it.\n\nOne of the trolls, named Thistle, decided to take a closer look. She carefully unscrewed the cap and took a sniff. Suddenly, she felt a strange sensation wash over her \u2013 a feeling of euphoria and hallucination.\n\nThe other trolls were amazed. They had never seen anything like it before. They begged Thistle to share the absinthe with them, but she refused. She wanted to keep it all to herself.\n\nBut as the days passed, Thistle became more and more obsessed with the absinthe. She would spend hours sitting by the stream, sipping on the bottle and watching the clouds pass by.\n\nOne day, while she was sitting there, she heard a voice behind her. It was the voice of the Radio 2 DJ, who had been following her for weeks, trying to get a glimpse of the mysterious troll who had discovered the absinthe.\n\nHe approached her cautiously, not wanting to scare her off. \u2018Hello there, my dear,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ve been following you for weeks, ever since I heard about the absinthe. I must say, you\u2019re quite the enigma.\u2019\n\nThistle looked up at him, startled. \u2018Who are you?\u2019 she asked.\n\n\u2018I am the Radio 2 DJ,\u2019 he replied. \u2018And I must say, I\u2019m quite taken with your unique taste in alcohol. May I have a sip?\u2019\n\nThistle hesitated for a moment, then handed him the bottle. The DJ took a sip and immediately felt the effects of the absinthe. He began to see strange visions \u2013 visions of the trolls dancing and singing, of the forest coming to life, of the sky turning green and purple.\n\nThe trolls laughed and danced, reveling in the absinthe\u2019s strange and mysterious powers. And the Radio 2 DJ, who had been known to christen \u2018Dallas\u2019 character Lucy Ewing \u2018The Poison Dwarf\u2019, joined in, feeling like he had found his true calling.\n\nAs the night wore on, the trolls continued to drink and dance, their senses heightened by the absinthe. They laughed and sang, their voices echoing through the forest.\n\nAnd as the sun began to rise, they stumbled back to their homes, exhausted but happy. They knew that they had discovered something truly special \u2013 something that would bring them joy and wonder for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe day after Shrove Tuesday, the trolls woke up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. They knew that they had experienced something truly magical, something that would stay with them forever. And as they went about their day, they couldn\u2019t help but think of the absinthe, and the strange and wonderful sensations it had brought them.\n\nWho wrote the 1951 novel \u2018From here to Eternity\u2019? The answer is: James Jones.\n\nAnd so, the trolls continued to live their lives, always searching for new and exciting experiences, always looking for something to bring them joy and wonder. For in the land of the trolls, there was always something new and strange to discover \u2013 something that would bring them closer to the magic and mystery of the world around them."}}], "usage": {}, "prompt": "Write a short and coherent story about Trolls that incorporates the answers to the following 10 questions: Who plays Nellie Forbush in the 2001 remake of the film \u2018South Pacific\u2019?

It was a book, bound in leather and adorned with strange symbols. As he opened the book, he discovered that it was a collection of stories and facts, written by a man named Matthew Boulton. Barney was fascinated by the book, and he spent hours poring over its pages, learning about the world beyond his icy home.\n\nAs he read, Barney discovered that the country he lived in was once known as Tylos, and that it was home to a great civilization of humans. He learned about the humans\u2019 love of sports, and how they would gather in large stadiums to watch games of rugby. Barney was particularly intrigued by the story of one team, the Adams Park Rangers, who played their home games at a stadium called Adams Park.\n\nBut Barney\u2019s adventure was interrupted by the arrival of a group of humans, who had come to the Ice Age world in search of a rare and valuable resource. The humans were led by a woman named Margo Channing, who was played by the actress Bette Davis in a 1950 film called \u2018All About Eve\u2019. Margo was a fierce and determined woman, and she was determined to find the resource at any cost.\n\nAs Barney watched, Margo and her team set up a base camp in the oak tree, and began to explore the surrounding area. Barney was fascinated by the humans, and he spent hours watching them from a distance, learning about their ways and their culture.\n\nBut as the days passed, Barney began to realize that the humans were not just curious about the Ice Age world \u2013 they were also hunting for something. And as he watched, he saw them capture a rare and beautiful cockerel, which they named \u2018Nugget\u2019. Barney was horrified, and he knew that he had to do something to save the cockerel.\n\nWith the help of his friends, Barney hatched a plan to rescue Nugget and expose the humans\u2019 true intentions. It was a risky move, but Barney was determined to succeed. And as he and his friends set out on their mission, they were aided by the host of the BBC television show QI, who provided them with valuable information and support.\n\nAs they journeyed through the Ice Age world, Barney and his friends encountered many dangers and obstacles, but they never gave up.

Ensure that the story is well-structured and easy to follow.\n\nStory:\n\nPocahontas, a young Native American woman, lived in the early 17th century in the Powhatan Confederacy, a group of Algonquian-speaking tribes in present-day Virginia. She was known for her kindness, intelligence, and love of nature. One day, a group of English colonists arrived in the area, led by King Henry III, who had recently ascended to the throne after the death of his brother, Prince Arthur. The colonists were seeking to establish a new settlement and were in need of supplies and resources.\n\nLady Penelope, a wealthy Englishwoman, had recently purchased a store near a crossroads in Annecy, France, which would eventually become the chain of European retailers known as Marks & Spencer. She had also invested in the development of a new type of flying machine, which was being tested by a group of daring pilots in the 1965 film \u2018Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines\u2019. The prize money for the fastest flight from London to Paris was \u00a310,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Pocahontas had befriended a skink, a small reptile that was native to the area. She had named him \u2018Thunderbird\u2019, after the mythical creature that was said to have created the mountains and rivers of the region. One day, while out exploring, Pocahontas stumbled upon a group of English colonists who were lost in the woods. She used her knowledge of the land to guide them back to their settlement, and soon became a trusted advisor to the colonists.\n\nIn 1969, the film \u2018Women in Love\u2019, starring Oliver Reed and Glenda Jackson, was released to critical acclaim. The film was directed by Ken Russell, who would go on to direct many other notable films, including \u2018The Devils\u2019 and \u2018Altered States\u2019. Mount Entoto, the highest peak overlooking the Ethiopian capital city of Addis Ababa, was also featured in the film.\n\nAs the years passed, Pocahontas became a symbol of hope and understanding between the Native American and English communities. She was known for her wisdom and compassion, and was revered by both sides. In 2012, Bradford City FC, a professional football club in England, presented the Dalai Lama with a personalised club shirt with the number 14 on the back, in recognition of his commitment to peace and understanding.\n\nPocahontas\u2019s story serves as a reminder that even in the face of adversity and conflict, there is always the possibility for understanding and cooperation. Her legacy lives on today, inspiring future generations to work towards a more peaceful and harmonious world."}}], "usage": {}, "prompt": "Write a short and coherent story about Pocahontas that incorporates the answers to the following 10 questions: For how many years did English monarch King Henry III reign?

The colonists were seeking to establish a new settlement and were in need of supplies and resources.\n\nLady Penelope, a wealthy Englishwoman, had recently purchased a store near a crossroads in Annecy, France, which would eventually become the chain of European retailers known as Marks & Spencer. She had also invested in the development of a new type of flying machine, which was being tested by a group of daring pilots in the 1965 film \u2018Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines\u2019. The prize money for the fastest flight from London to Paris was \u00a310,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Pocahontas had befriended a skink, a small reptile that was native to the area. She had named him \u2018Thunderbird\u2019, after the mythical creature that was said to have created the mountains and rivers of the region. One day, while out exploring, Pocahontas stumbled upon a group of English colonists who were lost in the woods. She used her knowledge of the land to guide them back to their settlement, and soon became a trusted advisor to the colonists.\n\nIn 1969, the film \u2018Women in Love\u2019, starring Oliver Reed and Glenda Jackson, was released to critical acclaim. The film was directed by Ken Russell, who would go on to direct many other notable films, including \u2018The Devils\u2019 and \u2018Altered States\u2019. Mount Entoto, the highest peak overlooking the Ethiopian capital city of Addis Ababa, was also featured in the film.\n\nAs the years passed, Pocahontas became a symbol of hope and understanding between the Native American and English communities. She was known for her wisdom and compassion, and was revered by both sides. In 2012, Bradford City FC, a professional football club in England, presented the Dalai Lama with a personalised club shirt with the number 14 on the back, in recognition of his commitment to peace and understanding.\n\nPocahontas\u2019s story serves as a reminder that even in the face of adversity and conflict, there is always the possibility for understanding and cooperation. Her legacy lives on today, inspiring future generations to work towards a more peaceful and harmonious world."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 10}], "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "model_type": "llama2", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "llama_config": {"task": "text-generation", "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "torch_dtype": "torch.float16", "device_map": "auto", "do_sample": false}, "task_data": {"questions": ["For how many years did English monarch King Henry III reign?", "What colour is Lady Penelope\u2019s car in the television puppet series \u2018Thunderbirds\u2019?", "Which chain of European retailers began with a store near a crossroads in Annecy, France in 1958?", "In the 1965 film \u2018Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines\u2019, how much is the prize money, in pounds sterling, for the fastest flight from London to Paris?", "Who directed the 1969 film \u2018Women in Love\u2019, starring Oliver Reed and Glenda Jackson?", "Mount Entoto is the highest peak overlooking which African capital city?", "A skink is what type of reptile?", "The 1960\u2019s television series \u2018Lost in Space\u2019 is set in which year?", "In 2012, Bradford City FC presented the Dalai Lama with a personalised club shirt with which number on the back?", "Michael, John, Steven and Susan are the children of which former US President?"], "answers": [["56", "fifty-six", "fifty six", "56"], ["Pink", "Pink the colour", "Momoiro", "Tamarisk (color)", "Neon pink", "Pastel pink", "FFD1DC", "Pinkest", "Lightish Red", "Pinkishness", "Light red", "Kinky pink", "Pinkness", "Tamarisk (colour)", "Pinkishly", "Pastel Pink", "FADADD", "Pink (color)", "Pinkly", "ffd1dc", "tamarisk colour", "pinkishly", "fadadd", "lightish red", "pinkly", "pinkishness", "kinky pink", "tamarisk color", "pink colour", "pinkest", "pastel pink", "pinkness", "neon pink", "pink color", "pink", "light red", "momoiro"], ["1Mobile", "Carrefour", "Carrefour Japan", "Carredour", "Carrefour Group", "Carrefour SA", "Carrefur", "Carrefour (company)", "Carefour", "Pryca", "Carrefour S.A.", "carrefour sa", "carrefour company", "carrefur", "1mobile", "carrefour", "carrefour japan", "carrefour group", "carredour", "carrefour s", "pryca", "carefour"], ["10,000", "10000", "ten thousand", "10000", "10 000", "ten thousand"], ["Henry Kenneth Russell", "Henry Kenneth Alfred Russell", "Henry Kenneth Alfred %22Ken%22 Russell", "Ken Russell", "Ken Russel", "henry kenneth russell", "henry kenneth alfred russell", "ken russel", "henry kenneth alfred 22ken 22 russell", "ken russell"], ["Ethiopian Natural History Museum", "Adis Abeba", "Addis Ababa, ET", "\u0100dd\u012bs \u0100beb\u0101", "\u0100d\u012bs \u0100beba", "Addis Abba, Ethiopia", "Addis Abba", "Tewodros Square", "Addis Abeba", "Addis Ababa Museum", "\u12a0\u12f2\u1235 \u12a0\u1260\u1263", "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia", "Capital of Ethiopia", "Ethiopian Ethnological Museum", "Addis Ababa", "Addis-Abeba", "New flower", "Addis Adaba", "Districts of Addis Ababa", "Adis Ababa", "The Grand Anwar Mosque (Addis Ababa)", "Adis abeda", "Finfinne", "adis abeba", "ethiopian natural history museum", "addis adaba", "grand anwar mosque addis ababa", "capital of ethiopia", "ethiopian ethnological museum", "addis ababa ethiopia", "districts of addis ababa", "\u12a0\u12f2\u1235 \u12a0\u1260\u1263", "addis ababa", "\u0101d\u012bs \u0101beba", "addis abba ethiopia", "adis abeda", "\u0101dd\u012bs \u0101beb\u0101", "addis abba", "addis ababa et", "finfinne", "tewodros square", "addis ababa museum", "new flower", "addis abeba", "adis ababa"], ["Lacertilian", "Lizards in captivity", "Lizards", "Lacertians", "Spotted lizard", "Lacertia", "Lacertilia", "Lizard", "Lacertian", "List of Lizards", "Lacertids", "Chipkali", "lacertilian", "lacertians", "lacertia", "lacertilia", "lacertids", "chipkali", "lizard", "lizards in captivity", "list of lizards", "spotted lizard", "lizards", "lacertian"], ["one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven", "1997", "one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven", "1997"], ["fourteen", "14", "fourteen", "14"], ["President Gerald R.

I imagined the cold, damp fields of the Scottish countryside, and the quiet, determined scientists working tirelessly in their lab.\n\nThe fourth question was about 'Steps in Time', the 1959 autobiography by American singer/actor Fred Astaire. I pictured Astaire, dressed in his finest suit and top hat, dancing across the stage with his trademark grace and elegance.\n\nThe fifth question was about the notorious historical figures John Rann, John MacLaine, James Hind and Claude Duval, who were all highwaymen. I could almost hear the sound of their horses' hooves pounding the ground as they rode across the countryside, their masks and pistols at the ready.\n\nThe sixth question was about Joey's surname in 'Friends', and I knew that one immediately: Tribbiani. I pictured Joey, with his big smile and his love of food, sitting on the couch with his friends, laughing and joking around.\n\nThe seventh question was about the comedian/actor who is credited with saying 'A man is only as old as the woman he feels', and I knew that one was George Burns. I could almost hear his gravelly voice and see his mischievous grin as I wrote.\n\nThe eighth question was about the official motto of the British armed forces, which is 'Be the best'. I pictured the brave soldiers, sailors, and airmen, standing tall and proud, ready to defend their country at a moment's notice.\n\nThe ninth question was about the bird whose feathers are said to bring bad luck if they are brought into the house, and I knew that one was the owl. I could almost hear its haunting hoot as I wrote.\n\nThe tenth question was about the official British coronation crown, which is the St. Edward's Crown. I pictured the crown, with its glittering jewels and intricate carvings, sitting on the head of the monarch, a symbol of power and tradition.\n\nAnd there you have it, ten questions answered in a story that takes you from the stage of 'The Full Monty' to the streets of Las Vegas, from the fields of Scotland to the pages of 'Steps in Time', and from the highwaymen of history to the brave men and women of the British armed forces.
