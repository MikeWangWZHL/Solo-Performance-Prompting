The play was a huge success and Superman was seen laughing and clapping in the front row.\n\nThe next day, Superman was reading the sports section of the newspaper when he saw that Martina Navratilova had won her first Wimbledon singles title. He remembered that he had seen her play at the tournament a few years earlier and was impressed by her skill and determination.\n\nA few days later, Superman was playing golf at the Metropolis Country Club when he saw a group of golfers struggling to play their shots. He recognized one of them as Jack Nicklaus, the defending champion of the British Open. Superman decided to join them and soon discovered that he was a natural at golf. He even managed to beat Nicklaus in a few holes.\n\nAs he was leaving the course, Superman saw a strange bridge in the distance. It was the Sky Train Rail bridge, which was still under construction. Superman decided to investigate and soon discovered that the bridge was not stable and was in danger of collapsing. He quickly used his super strength to hold up the bridge until the engineers could fix it. The people of Metropolis were grateful and the bridge was completed safely.\n\nSuperman had saved the day once again, and as he flew back to the Daily Planet, he couldn't help but think about the great play he had seen the night before. He was glad that he had decided to attend the opening night of Osbert Lancaster's new play. It had been a great night out and he was already looking forward to the next one."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 0, "question_count": 5}], "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "model_type": "llama2", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "llama_config": {"task": "text-generation", "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "torch_dtype": "torch.float16", "device_map": "auto", "do_sample": false}, "task_data": {"questions": ["\"In which movie did Garbo say, \"\"I want to be alone\"\".\"", "What is Osbert Lancaster best known for producing?", "Who was the defending champion when Martina Navratilova first won Wimbledon singles?", "Who was the first US-born winner of golf's British Open?", "In which country is the Sky Train Rail bridge?"], "answers": [["The grand hotel", "Grand H\u00f4tel", "Grand hotel", "The Grand Hotel", "Grand Hotel", "Grand Hotel (disambiguation)", "grand hotel disambiguation", "grand h\u00f4tel", "grand hotel"], ["Cartoonish", "Cartoons", "American cartoon", "Cartoon", "Cartoonistic", "Cartoonism", "cartoonish", "cartoons", "cartoon", "cartoonistic", "cartoonism", "american cartoon"], ["Virginia Wade", "Sarah Virginia Wade", "virginia wade", "sarah virginia wade"], ["Walter Hagen", "Hagen, Walter", "Walter Charles Hagen", "hagen walter", "walter hagen", "walter charles hagen"], ["Canada", "Canad\u00e1", "The Dominion of Canada", "Commonwealth of Canada", "Dominion of canada", "ISO 3166-1:CA", "Etymology of Canada", "CANADA", "Canadiophile", "Canada's", "\u1472\u14c7\u1455", "Canada/References", "America's top hat", "Canada.", "Cnada", "\u010canada", "Canadian Federation", "Kenadian", "Canadialand", "Xanada", "Dominion of Canada", "Canadaa", "canada s", "canad\u00e1", "\u1472\u14c7\u1455", "\u010danada", "canadaa", "america s top hat", "cnada", "kenadian", "xanada", "canadian federation", "iso 3166 1 ca", "canadialand", "canada", "canada references", "dominion of canada", "commonwealth of canada", "etymology of canada", "canadiophile"]], "question_ids": ["tc_759", "tc_783", "tc_812", "tc_827", "tc_841"], "topic": "Superman"}}

The Golden Egg was the source of their power and strength, and without it, the Birds would lose their ability to fly and fight against the green pigs.\n\nThe Birds knew that the only way to get the Golden Egg was to find the legendary Golden Nest, where it was said to be hidden. But the Golden Nest was guarded by a powerful and fierce dragon, named Blaze. Blaze was as bright as 23 Suns, and his fiery breath could melt any material.\n\nThe Birds knew they needed to find a way to defeat Blaze and get the Golden Egg. They decided to seek the help of the wise old owl, who lived on a nearby mountain. The owl told them that the only way to defeat Blaze was to use a special mineral called Gypsum. Gypsum was as strong as steel, but light as a feather. It could withstand Blaze's fiery breath and protect the Birds from his flames.\n\nThe Birds set out to find Gypsum, and after a long and difficult journey, they found a cave filled with the mineral. They used Gypsum to create casts, moulds, and blackboard chalk to protect themselves from Blaze's flames.\n\nAs they approached the Golden Nest, they noticed that the Pup, a small and cute creature, was orbiting around Blaze.

The Golden Egg was the source of their power and strength, and without it, the Birds would lose their ability to fly and fight against the green pigs.\n\nThe Birds knew that the only way to get the Golden Egg was to find the legendary Golden Nest, where it was said to be hidden. But the Golden Nest was guarded by a powerful and fierce dragon, named Blaze. Blaze was as bright as 23 Suns, and his fiery breath could melt any material.\n\nThe Birds knew they needed to find a way to defeat Blaze and get the Golden Egg. They decided to seek the help of the wise old owl, who lived on a nearby mountain. The owl told them that the only way to defeat Blaze was to use a special mineral called Gypsum. Gypsum was as strong as steel, but light as a feather. It could withstand Blaze's fiery breath and protect the Birds from his flames.\n\nThe Birds set out to find Gypsum, and after a long and difficult journey, they found a cave filled with the mineral. They used Gypsum to create casts, moulds, and blackboard chalk to protect themselves from Blaze's flames.\n\nAs they approached the Golden Nest, they noticed that the Pup, a small and cute creature, was orbiting around Blaze. The Pup was attracted to the Birds' feathers, and they knew they could use it to their advantage.

However, the evil Prince Humperdinck, who wanted to marry Buttercup for her wealth and beauty, kidnapped her and held her captive in his castle.\n\nOne day, while Buttercup was sitting in her tower room, she heard a knock on the door. She opened it to find a tall, handsome man with a strong build and a charming smile. It was none other than Nick Rowan, the famous Eastenders actor who had played the role of a policeman in a TV series. He had come to rescue her from the clutches of Prince Humperdinck.\n\nAs they made their escape from the castle, they were joined by a strange but lovable creature named Boris, who was a giant, talking tarantula. Boris was the subject of a famous song by The Who, and he had a special bond with Buttercup. Together, they journeyed through the forest, facing many dangers and obstacles along the way.\n\nAs they rested by a river, Homer Simpson, the lovable oaf from Springfield, appeared out of nowhere, drinking a cold beer. He had heard about Buttercup's plight and had come to offer his help. He was a big fan of Princess Bride and had seen it many times, singing the famous song White Christmas along with the characters.\n\nAs they continued their journey, they were joined by a young and talented Pop Idol named G4, who had a number one hit in 2004 called All This Time. G4 had heard about Buttercup's beauty and had come to sing for her, hoping to win her heart.\n\nTogether, this unlikely group of heroes battled against the evil Prince Humperdinck and his henchmen, fighting for love, justice, and the freedom of the beautiful Princess Buttercup. In the end, they were successful, and Buttercup was reunited with her true love, Westley. They lived happily ever after, and the memory of their bravery and sacrifice was remembered for generations to come."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 0, "question_count": 5}], "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "model_type": "llama2", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "", "llama_config": {"task": "text-generation", "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "torch_dtype": "torch.float16", "device_map": "auto", "do_sample": false}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which Eastenders actor has played the policeman Nick Rowan on TV?", "What type of animal was Boris, the subject of a song by The Who?", "Which brand of beer does Homer Simpson drink regularly?", "In which film was the song White Christmas first sung?", "Which Pop Idol had a number one hit in 2004 called All This Time?"], "answers": [["Nick Berry", "nick berry"], ["Egg sac", "Arachnea", "Araneidan", "Spider (animal)", "Araneid", "Spider", "Egg sack", "Araneae", "Araneids", "Spider's", "Spiders", "\ud83d\udd77", "Kumo (spider)", "Spider venoms", "egg sac", "kumo spider", "spider s", "arachnea", "araneidan", "spider animal", "spiders", "araneae", "\ud83d\udd77", "spider", "egg sack", "spider venoms", "araneids", "araneid"], ["Duff", "Duff (disambiguation)", "duff", "duff disambiguation"], ["Great Sign", "Holiday inn", "Holidex", "Wallace E.
