Elsa was a huge fan of musicals, and her favorite was \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" which featured the hit song \"If I Were A Rich Man.\" She often dreamt of performing on stage and becoming a star.\n\nOne day, Elsa stumbled upon a dusty old bookshop and found a copy of \"Mutiny on the Bounty,\" a famous novel she had always wanted to read. She was thrilled to discover that it had two sequels, \"Men Against the Sea\" and \"Pitcairn's Island.\" She couldn't wait to dive into the adventure-filled pages.\n\nAs Elsa read, she became fascinated by the life of Truman Capote, the author of \"In Cold Blood.\" She learned that his original last name was Persons before he was adopted by his stepfather. This fact inspired her to learn more about the lives of other famous authors.\n\nOne evening, Elsa attended a poetry reading where she heard Lewis Carroll's poem \"The Hunting of the Snark.\" She was captivated by the story of the elusive, troublesome snark that turned into a boojum to fool hunters. The poem's whimsical nature reminded her of the importance of imagination and creativity.\n\nElsa was also intrigued by stories from the Bible, particularly the tale of Joshua, before whom the sun and moon stood still. She admired his faith and determination, which motivated her to face her own challenges with courage.\n\nOne day, Elsa watched the movie \"Dangerous Minds,\" starring Michelle Pfeiffer. The film's powerful message was amplified by Coolio's song \"Gangsta's Paradise,\" which became one of her favorite tunes.\n\nElsa's interest in history led her to learn about President Gerald Ford, whose middle name was Rudolph.

Elsa was a huge fan of musicals, and her favorite was \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" which featured the hit song \"If I Were A Rich Man.\" She often dreamt of performing on stage and becoming a star.\n\nOne day, Elsa stumbled upon a dusty old bookshop and found a copy of \"Mutiny on the Bounty,\" a famous novel she had always wanted to read. She was thrilled to discover that it had two sequels, \"Men Against the Sea\" and \"Pitcairn's Island.\" She couldn't wait to dive into the adventure-filled pages.\n\nAs Elsa read, she became fascinated by the life of Truman Capote, the author of \"In Cold Blood.\" She learned that his original last name was Persons before he was adopted by his stepfather. This fact inspired her to learn more about the lives of other famous authors.\n\nOne evening, Elsa attended a poetry reading where she heard Lewis Carroll's poem \"The Hunting of the Snark.\" She was captivated by the story of the elusive, troublesome snark that turned into a boojum to fool hunters. The poem's whimsical nature reminded her of the importance of imagination and creativity.\n\nElsa was also intrigued by stories from the Bible, particularly the tale of Joshua, before whom the sun and moon stood still. She admired his faith and determination, which motivated her to face her own challenges with courage.\n\nOne day, Elsa watched the movie \"Dangerous Minds,\" starring Michelle Pfeiffer. The film's powerful message was amplified by Coolio's song \"Gangsta's Paradise,\" which became one of her favorite tunes.\n\nElsa's interest in history led her to learn about President Gerald Ford, whose middle name was Rudolph.

The villain planned to use this material to create a powerful weapon that could evaporate water, causing a change of state from liquid to gas, known as vaporization.\n\nThe Incredibles knew they had to stop the villain, so they turned to their friend, Professor Arithmos, who was an expert in the branch of science that has four fundamental principles: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, called arithmetic. Professor Arithmos devised a plan to track down the villain using his knowledge of mathematics.\n\nTo execute the plan, the Incredibles needed the help of the fastest animal on two legs, the ostrich. They found one named Speedy, who lived in a unique part of the city where mosses, which belong to the plant kingdom's division Bryophyta, thrived. Speedy agreed to help the Incredibles in their mission.\n\nAs they ventured through the city, they came across a squirrel, a rodent that rears its young, called kittens, in a nest called a drey. The squirrel informed them that the villain was hiding near a beaver's lodge, a structure built by the mammal to store food, rear young, and pass the winter.\n\nThe Incredibles and Speedy approached the villain's hideout, which was surrounded by plants that grow in water or water-logged conditions, known as hydrophytes. They carefully made their way through the swampy area and found the villain inside the hideout.\n\nDuring the confrontation, the villain revealed that he had also stolen a powerful device that could control the heart's pacemaker, scientifically known as the sinoatrial node. The Incredibles knew they had to act quickly to save the city and its citizens.\n\nWith their combined powers and the help of Speedy, they defeated the villain and retrieved both the stolen silica and the pacemaker-controlling device. As they returned the materials to their rightful places, the city of Materia was saved, and the Incredibles were once again hailed as heroes.\n\nIn the end, the Incredibles learned the importance of teamwork and the power of knowledge, as they had used information from various branches of science to save the day. The city of Materia continued to thrive, and the Incredibles remained ever vigilant, ready to protect their home from any future threats."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos":

Later that night, they watched the film \"Gremlins\" and learned about the three important rules for taking care of a Gremlin: not feeding them after midnight, not getting them wet, and not exposing them to bright light.\n\nOn his journey to learn more about the world, Bilbo discovered that the Canary Islands were named after dogs, not birds as he had initially thought. This led him to ponder the importance of names and their meanings. He also learned about the Rolling Stones and their song \"Angie,\" inspired by a woman with the surname Pallenberg. Bilbo was moved by the power of music and its ability to tell stories.\n\nThrough his quest for knowledge, Bilbo Baggins gained a deeper understanding of the world beyond the Shire. He realized that there was so much more to discover and vowed to continue his journey, embracing the spirit of adventure that had been awakened within him."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which Channel 4 TV show's presenters included Mark Lamarr, Amanda De Cadenet and Terry Christian?", "Who won the Ladies singles title at Wimbledon in 2004?", "In which year did St George die?", "What are the names of the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse?", "Who is the Vice-President for George W Bush?", "Which film sees Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner and Donald Sutherland as retired astronauts?", "In a standard deck of cards, how many Kings have a moustache?", "According to the film Gremlins, if you are looking after a Gremlin you should not feed him after midnight, not get him wet and not expose him to what?", "The Canary Islands are named after what animal?", "What was the surname of the woman who was the inspiration behind the Rolling Stones song Angie?"], "answers": [["The Word", "The Word (film)", "The word", "The Word (disambiguation)", "word", "word film", "word disambiguation"], ["\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0428\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430", "Maria sharapova", "Sharapova", "Maria Shirapova", "Sugarpova.com", "Sugarpova", "Maria Sharapova", "Maria Sharapova (Model)", "Maria Sharapova career history", "Marija Sarapova", "Mariya Sarapova", "\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0301\u044f \u042e\u0301\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0428\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0301\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430", "Maria Scharapowa", "Masha Sharapova", "Maria Sjarapova", "Marija \u0160arapova", "Maria Szarapowa", "\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0301\u044f \u0428\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0301\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430", "Maria Sharpova", "Maria Yuryevna Sharapova", "Maria shirapova", "Maria Sugarpova", "marija sarapova", "marija \u0161arapova", "\u043c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0301\u044f \u044e\u0301\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0448\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0301\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430", "masha sharapova", "\u043c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0448\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430", "mariya sarapova", "maria sugarpova", "maria scharapowa", "maria sharapova model", "\u043c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0301\u044f \u0448\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0301\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430", "sugarpova", "sugarpova com", "maria sharpova", "maria shirapova", "maria sharapova", "maria sharapova career history", "maria sjarapova", "maria szarapowa", "maria yuryevna sharapova", "sharapova"], ["three hundred and three", "303", "303", "three hundred and three"], ["War, Famine, Pestilence and Death", "war famine pestilence and death"], ["Dick chenny", "Dick cheyney", "Richard Cheney", "Dick Cheney", "Richard B.

President Pompidou invited the Smurfs and the Ghostbusters to visit France as a token of gratitude for their heroic deeds.\n\nExcited about the adventure, Mr. Benn, a friend of the Smurfs, decided to join them.

They decided to take a detour to the southwestern Philippines to explore the beautiful chain of islands called the Sulu Archipelago. The Smurfs marveled at the breathtaking scenery and enjoyed their time in the tropical paradise.\n\nAs their journey came to an end, the group remembered the tragic event of the ferry named Herald of Free Enterprise, which capsized after leaving Zeebrugge in 1987. They held a moment of silence for the lives lost in the tragedy.\n\nThe Smurfs, Ghostbusters, Mr. Benn, and their new friends returned to the Smurf Village, grateful for the unforgettable adventure they had shared.

The Ghostbusters had recently helped the Smurfs defeat an evil spirit that had been haunting their village.\n\nDuring the preparations, Papa Smurf received a letter from the French President, Georges Pompidou, who had succeeded General Charles de Gaulle in 1969. President Pompidou invited the Smurfs and the Ghostbusters to visit France as a token of gratitude for their heroic deeds.\n\nExcited about the adventure, Mr. Benn, a friend of the Smurfs, decided to join them. He visited a magical costume shop to find the perfect outfit for the trip. While trying on different costumes, he stumbled upon a book about the history of cheese-making. Intrigued, he learned that the enzyme called rennet is added to milk to coagulate it, making \"curds and whey.\"\n\nAs the group arrived in London before heading to France, they marveled at the city's history and innovation. They visited the site where the first escalators were installed in 1898, which was at Harrods department store.\n\nDuring their journey, they met a mysterious character who had been played by various actors, including Jack Lord, Cec Linder, Rik Van Nutter, Norman Burton, David Hedison, John Terry, David Hedison, and Jeffrey Wright. This character was none other than the famous secret agent, Felix Leiter.\n\nFelix introduced the group to a talented magician named David Nixon, who had first introduced the world to the beloved puppet, Basil Brush. The Smurfs and their friends were delighted by his magical performance.\n\nWhile exploring the city, they stumbled upon a monument dedicated to Spencer Perceval, the only Prime Minister of Britain to be assassinated. The Smurfs and their friends paid their respects and learned about the importance of peace and unity.\n\nAfter their adventures in London, the group finally arrived in France. They decided to take a detour to the southwestern Philippines to explore the beautiful chain of islands called the Sulu Archipelago. The Smurfs marveled at the breathtaking scenery and enjoyed their time in the tropical paradise.\n\nAs their journey came to an end, the group remembered the tragic event of the ferry named Herald of Free Enterprise, which capsized after leaving Zeebrugge in 1987. They held a moment of silence for the lives lost in the tragedy.\n\nThe Smurfs, Ghostbusters, Mr. Benn, and their new friends returned to the Smurf Village, grateful for the unforgettable adventure they had shared.

The team was led by their coach, Queen Elizabeth I, who famously said, \"I don't wish to open windows into men's souls.\" She believed in the importance of unity and teamwork, and her wise words inspired the young players.\n\nOne day, the team faced a challenging opponent, a group of goblins led by Jareth the Goblin King, played by the legendary British singer David Bowie.

They brought with them a group of Yellow-pine, Uinta, and Lodgepole chipmunks, who were excited to explore the Teletubbyland and play with the Teletubbies.\n\nAs the celebration continued, Daphne from the 2002 film 'Scooby-Doo', played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, arrived in her Mystery Machine. She was greeted by the Teletubbies, who were eager to learn more about her adventures. Daphne taught them the NATO phonetic alphabet, and they were particularly fascinated by the word 'Charlie', which represented the letter 'C'.\n\nDuring the event, a former RAF pilot named Arthur Hailey, who had written the novel 'Airport', shared his thrilling experiences with the Teletubbies. He also introduced them to the sport of falconry, where a creance, a long fine cord, is used to train the birds.\n\nAs the day went on, Mr. Bean arrived in his iconic green 1972 Mini 1000 Mark IV, which he drove carefully around Teletubbyland. He reminded everyone about the importance of wearing seat belts, as it had become compulsory in the UK in 1983 for front seat passengers.\n\nThe Teletubbies and their guests gathered around to listen to the story of Boutros Ghali, the Prime Minister of Egypt who was assassinated in 1910. They paid tribute to his memory and reflected on the importance of peace and unity.\n\nThe celebration in Teletubbyland was a day filled with joy, learning, and friendship.

Fu Manchu was on a quest to find the sword and mask of Genghis Khan, which would grant him immense power. The Power Rangers knew they had to stop him before it was too late.\n\nThe team consisted of nine members, just like a baseball team, each with their own unique abilities and strengths. They were led by the Red Ranger, who was known for his wisdom and courage. The Red Ranger was a descendant of the British monarchy and held the title of the Supreme Governor of the Church of England.\n\nOne day, while the Power Rangers were strategizing their plan to defeat Fu Manchu, they stumbled upon a mysterious poem called \"Monday's Child.\" They discovered that Wednesday's child was full of woe, which they believed could be the key to unlocking Fu Manchu's weakness.\n\nAs they continued their investigation, they found a clue in the archives of the famous newspaper, The Times, which was relaunched from the 'Daily Universal Register' in 1788. The article mentioned a connection between Fu Manchu and a woman named Bertha Mason, who was Mr. Rochester's first wife in the novel 'Jane Eyre' by Charlotte Bronte.\n\nThe Power Rangers decided to visit Kensington Gardens in London, where they found a bronze statue of Peter Pan, the fictional character created by J.M. Barrie. They believed that the statue held a secret message from the author of 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,' Muriel Spark, who was known for her wisdom and insight.\n\nUpon deciphering the message, the Power Rangers discovered that the mask worn by Fu Manchu was based on a painting by the artist Edvard Munch, known for his famous work 'The Scream.' They realized that the key to defeating Fu Manchu was to confront him with the power of woe, as mentioned in the poem 'Monday's Child.'\n\nThe Power Rangers sought the help of a legendary US athlete, Dick Fosbury, who won a gold medal for the high jump in the 1968 Summer Olympics. With his guidance, they trained to harness the power of woe and combined it with their athletic abilities.\n\nIn the final battle, the Power Rangers confronted Fu Manchu and used their newfound powers to defeat him. As Fu Manchu's mask shattered, the sword and mask of Genghis Khan were safely recovered, and the city of London was saved.\n\nThe Power Rangers, victorious and united, continued to protect the world from evil, knowing that their strength came from their unity and the wisdom of the past."}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 543, "prompt_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 777}, "prompt": "Write a short and coherent story about Power Rangers that incorporates the answers to the following 10 questions: Who always holds the title of the Supreme Governor of the Church of England?

Fu Manchu was on a quest to find the sword and mask of Genghis Khan, which would grant him immense power. The Power Rangers knew they had to stop him before it was too late.\n\nThe team consisted of nine members, just like a baseball team, each with their own unique abilities and strengths. They were led by the Red Ranger, who was known for his wisdom and courage. The Red Ranger was a descendant of the British monarchy and held the title of the Supreme Governor of the Church of England.\n\nOne day, while the Power Rangers were strategizing their plan to defeat Fu Manchu, they stumbled upon a mysterious poem called \"Monday's Child.\" They discovered that Wednesday's child was full of woe, which they believed could be the key to unlocking Fu Manchu's weakness.\n\nAs they continued their investigation, they found a clue in the archives of the famous newspaper, The Times, which was relaunched from the 'Daily Universal Register' in 1788. The article mentioned a connection between Fu Manchu and a woman named Bertha Mason, who was Mr. Rochester's first wife in the novel 'Jane Eyre' by Charlotte Bronte.\n\nThe Power Rangers decided to visit Kensington Gardens in London, where they found a bronze statue of Peter Pan, the fictional character created by J.M. Barrie. They believed that the statue held a secret message from the author of 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,' Muriel Spark, who was known for her wisdom and insight.\n\nUpon deciphering the message, the Power Rangers discovered that the mask worn by Fu Manchu was based on a painting by the artist Edvard Munch, known for his famous work 'The Scream.' They realized that the key to defeating Fu Manchu was to confront him with the power of woe, as mentioned in the poem 'Monday's Child.'\n\nThe Power Rangers sought the help of a legendary US athlete, Dick Fosbury, who won a gold medal for the high jump in the 1968 Summer Olympics. With his guidance, they trained to harness the power of woe and combined it with their athletic abilities.\n\nIn the final battle, the Power Rangers confronted Fu Manchu and used their newfound powers to defeat him. As Fu Manchu's mask shattered, the sword and mask of Genghis Khan were safely recovered, and the city of London was saved.\n\nThe Power Rangers, victorious and united, continued to protect the world from evil, knowing that their strength came from their unity and the wisdom of the past."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 10, "question_count": 10}], "model":

She was excited to wear a beautiful dress designed by the famous British fashion designer, Hardy Amies, who was known for designing the costumes for the film '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Moana's best friend, a mischievous boy named Oliver Twist, was also attending the celebration with his loyal dog, Bullseye.\n\nOn the day of the event, Moana and Oliver decided to take the London Underground rail system to reach the venue. They chose the District Line, as it was the only line that interconnected with every other line, making it the most convenient option. As they traveled, they discussed their favorite films, and Oliver mentioned how much he enjoyed watching James Gandolfini play the sadistic military prison commandant Colonel Winter in the 2001 film starring Robert Redford.\n\nUpon arriving at the celebration, Moana and Oliver were greeted by a variety of animals, including a female gerbil named Jill, who was the guest of honor. They also met a friendly dragon named Idris, who reminded them of the character from the children's television series 'Ivor the Engine'. As they explored the venue, they stumbled upon a group of ferrets, which they learned was called a \"business.\"\n\nThe celebration was filled with laughter and joy, as guests marveled at the Gentoo, Adelie, and Macaroni penguins that waddled around the venue. Moana and Oliver admired the various fashion choices of the attendees, noticing the Straight Cut, Boot Cut, and Skinny jeans that were popular among the crowd.\n\nAs the night went on, Moana and Oliver were thrilled to discover that the entertainment for the evening was a performance from the stage musical 'Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat'. They were amazed to learn that Phillip Schofield, Jason Donovan, and Donny Osmond had all played the starring role in the production.\n\nThe magical celebration on the island of Moana was a night to remember, filled with enchanting creatures, captivating stories, and unforgettable moments.

As they set up the projector, they chatted about their favorite actors, including Russell Crowe, who played boxer Jim Braddock in the 2005 film \"Cinderella Man.\"\n\nOne of the Minions, Bob, was a huge fan of thrillers and couldn't stop talking about the 1986 film \"The Hitcher,\" in which Rutger Hauer played the murderous hitch-hiker John Ryder. As the Minions continued their conversation, they decided to serve some northern English beer at their movie night. They chose Newcastle Brown Ale, originally launched by Col. James Porter in 1927.\n\nAs the movie night began, the Minions couldn't help but discuss other films they loved, like the Star Wars series. They laughed about the slug-like alien, Jabba the Hutt, who had a bounty on Han Solo for dumping an illegal cargo. Their conversation then shifted to sports, and they debated the outcome of the upcoming Cook Cup, a rugby union challenge cup contested by Australia and England.\n\nDuring the intermission, the Minions decided to try surfing the next day. They researched surfboards and learned about the fin underneath the rear of a surfboard, called the skeg.

As they set up the projector, they chatted about their favorite actors, including Russell Crowe, who played boxer Jim Braddock in the 2005 film \"Cinderella Man.\"\n\nOne of the Minions, Bob, was a huge fan of thrillers and couldn't stop talking about the 1986 film \"The Hitcher,\" in which Rutger Hauer played the murderous hitch-hiker John Ryder. As the Minions continued their conversation, they decided to serve some northern English beer at their movie night. They chose Newcastle Brown Ale, originally launched by Col. James Porter in 1927.\n\nAs the movie night began, the Minions couldn't help but discuss other films they loved, like the Star Wars series. They laughed about the slug-like alien, Jabba the Hutt, who had a bounty on Han Solo for dumping an illegal cargo. Their conversation then shifted to sports, and they debated the outcome of the upcoming Cook Cup, a rugby union challenge cup contested by Australia and England.\n\nDuring the intermission, the Minions decided to try surfing the next day. They researched surfboards and learned about the fin underneath the rear of a surfboard, called the skeg. As they continued their movie night, they watched the 1994 film \"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\" written by Richard Curtis.\n\nThe next morning, while preparing for their surfing adventure, the Minions stumbled upon a nardoo plant, a type of fern.

Gary was a huge fan of the British band Take That, which consisted of members Gary, Jason, Mark, and Howard. He spent his days listening to their music, especially their 2001 album, 'Amnesiac.'\n\nOne day, while exploring the nearby mountains, Gary stumbled upon a small mountain lake, known as a tarn. As he approached the tarn, he discovered a mysterious dragon egg. Excited by his discovery, he decided to take the egg home and learn how to train the dragon that would eventually hatch from it.\n\nGary began researching everything he could about dragons and their training. He came across the teachings of the Greek philosopher Diogenes, who was said to have lived inside a barrel. Inspired by Diogenes' wisdom, Gary decided to apply the philosopher's principles to his dragon training.\n\nAs the days passed, the dragon egg finally hatched, revealing a magnificent creature. Gary named the dragon Astapovo, after the Russian author Leo Tolstoy, who had died at Astapovo Railway Station in 1910 of pneumonia.

Gary was a huge fan of the British band Take That, which consisted of members Gary, Jason, Mark, and Howard. He spent his days listening to their music, especially their 2001 album, 'Amnesiac.'\n\nOne day, while exploring the nearby mountains, Gary stumbled upon a small mountain lake, known as a tarn. As he approached the tarn, he discovered a mysterious dragon egg. Excited by his discovery, he decided to take the egg home and learn how to train the dragon that would eventually hatch from it.\n\nGary began researching everything he could about dragons and their training. He came across the teachings of the Greek philosopher Diogenes, who was said to have lived inside a barrel. Inspired by Diogenes' wisdom, Gary decided to apply the philosopher's principles to his dragon training.\n\nAs the days passed, the dragon egg finally hatched, revealing a magnificent creature. Gary named the dragon Astapovo, after the Russian author Leo Tolstoy, who had died at Astapovo Railway Station in 1910 of pneumonia. Gary and Astapovo quickly formed a strong bond, and the young boy began teaching the dragon various skills and tricks.\n\nOne day, while practicing their flying skills, Gary and Astapovo encountered a man who claimed to have met a man with seven wives while going to St Ives.

Their efforts caught the attention of a famous author named Malcolm Bradbury, who had written the 1975 novel 'The History Man'. Inspired by the bugs' determination, he decided to write a story about their plight, bringing attention to their cause and ultimately saving their home.\n\nIn the end, the insect community's teamwork and determination paid off. Their home was saved, and they continued to thrive and grow, inspired by the knowledge that even the smallest creatures can make a difference in the world."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 7, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["The World Bog Snorkelling Championships are held annually in which European country?", "The largest known volcano in our solar system is on which planet?", "Which Scottish physician and novelist created Dr Finlay?", "How many double-word score squares are there on a standard Scrabble board?", "What it the title of the second James Bond film, which opened in the UK in 1963?", "What were the names of the founder of British company JCB?", "In the Anna Sewell novel, what is Black Beauty?", "American singer Al, late British television host Hughie and British businessman Philip all share which surname?", "The fictitious station of Walford East, which features in the UK television series \u2018Eastenders\u2019, replaces which London Underground station on the tube map?", "Who wrote the 1975 novel \u2018The History Man\u2019?"], "answers": [["Welsh nation", "Climate of Wales", "Autonomous Province of Wales", "Cymru / wales", "Cyrmu", "Wales", "WALES", "Rain in Wales", "Welsh Nation", "Welsh Peninsula", "Wales, UK", "Etymology of Wales", "Cymru", "Wales, United Kingdom", "Pays de Galles", "Communications in Wales", "The Principality of Wales", "West of the Rhymney", "Wales, U.K.", "Cymru am byth", "Gymru", "Cymru / Wales", "Welsh mountains", "CYMRU", "principality of wales", "welsh mountains", "wales", "wales u k", "cyrmu", "etymology of wales", "communications in wales", "gymru", "cymru am byth", "autonomous province of wales", "welsh peninsula", "wales united kingdom", "pays de galles", "climate of wales", "cymru wales", "welsh nation", "rain in wales", "west of rhymney", "cymru", "wales uk"], ["Fourth planet", "Sol 4", "Mars surface features", "Mars", "Mars/Planet", "Hydrology of Mars", "Magnetosphere of Mars", "Marte (planet)", "Mars (planet)", "Sol-4", "2003 opposition of Mars", "4th planet", "Planet Mars", "Sun e", "Sol e", "Mars (Planet)", "Physical characteristics of Mars", "Mars opposition", "Sol IV", "Oblate Mars", "Opposition of Mars", "Mars orbit", "fourth planet", "mars", "oblate mars", "mars surface features", "4th planet", "marte planet", "2003 opposition of mars", "mars opposition", "hydrology of mars", "planet mars", "sol e", "opposition of mars", "sun e", "mars orbit", "physical characteristics of mars", "sol 4", "mars planet", "magnetosphere of mars", "sol iv"], ["Archibald Cronin", "A J Cronin", "A.J.
