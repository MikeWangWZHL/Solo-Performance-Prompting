You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints!

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance!

Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

They were inspired by the stories of famous historical figures, such as Catherine Parr, who had been married four times, including to the infamous King Henry VIII.\n\nTheir journey began in Switzerland, where they visited the ancient castle that gave the Habsburg dynasty its name. The pets marveled at the grandeur of the castle and imagined the lives of the royals who once lived there.\n\nAs they continued their adventure, the pets found themselves in the United Kingdom, where they learned about the European Parliament and its 87 seats for UK members elected for a five-year term. They were fascinated by the first-past-the-post voting system and how it shaped the political landscape.\n\nDuring their travels, the pets also discovered the world of music and the enchanting voice of Edith Piaf, known as \"The Little Sparrow.\" Her songs filled their hearts with joy and inspired them to embrace their own unique talents.\n\nIn the end, the pets returned home, grateful for the knowledge they had gained and the bonds they had formed.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance!

Gene, the main character, discovers that he has the power to control the release of progesterone, a hormone that helps control ovulation in humans. He realizes that this newfound ability can help him understand human emotions better.\n\nMeanwhile, the atmosphere in Textopolis starts to change, and the emojis notice that oxygen, the second most common gas in the atmosphere, is becoming scarce. They must find a way to restore the balance before it's too late. As the emojis explore the human world, they come across a lake suffering from eutrophication, the nutrient enrichment of lakes. They learn about the importance of preserving the environment and decide to help clean the lake.\n\nDuring their journey, the emojis encounter five-legged creatures that have damaged the Great Wall of China, a 1250-mile long wonder of the world. The emojis join forces with the locals to repair the wall and protect it from further damage. In the end, the emojis return to Textopolis, having learned valuable lessons about the human world. They share their experiences with their fellow emojis, including the fact that the Earth has an approximate circumference of 24,901 miles (40,075 kilometers)."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 2, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "spp_profile", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which hormone helps control ovulation?", "What is the second most common gas in the atmosphere?", "What is the term for nutrient enrichment of lakes?", "Five-legged creatures have damaged which 1250 mile long wonder of the world?", "What is the approximate circumference of the earth?"], "answers": [["Receptors, lh", "LH surge", "Leutenizing hormone", "Ovulation prediction kit", "Luteinizing", "Pee stick", "Interstitial-cell stimulating hormone", "Lh kit", "ATCvet code QG03GA07", "Lutropin alfa", "Lutropin", "Lutenizing Hormone", "Luteinizing hormone", "Lh test", "Luteinising hormone", "Luveris", "Leutinizing hormone", "Interstitial cell stimulating hormone", "Lutenising Hormone", "Lutenizing hormone", "Ovulation predictor kit", "ATC code G03GA07", "Luteinizing Hormone", "Luteinising Hormone", "Interstitial Cell Stimulating Hormone", "receptors lh", "leutenizing hormone", "lutropin alfa", "lutropin", "lh kit", "ovulation predictor kit", "lutenising hormone", "atcvet code qg03ga07", "pee stick", "ovulation prediction kit", "luteinizing", "interstitial cell stimulating hormone", "lutenizing hormone", "leutinizing hormone", "atc code g03ga07", "lh surge", "lh test", "luteinizing hormone", "luteinising hormone", "luveris"], ["Oxyjunn", "Oxygen rings", "Active oxygen", "Vital air", "ATC code V03AN01", "ATCvet code QV03AN01", "History of oxygen", "Atomic number 8", "Oxygyn", "Oxygen gas", "O\u2082", "Dioxygen molecule", "Diatomic oxide", "Diatomic Oxygen", "Oxygen ion", "Sauerstoff", "Oxygen", "Oxygen partial pressure", "Pure oxygen", "Oxygen atom", "Molecular oxygen", "Oxygen Atom", "Element 8", "O (element)", "0xygen", "Oxigen", "E948", "dioxygen molecule", "molecular oxygen", "atcvet code qv03an01", "element 8", "e948", "sauerstoff", "oxyjunn", "0xygen", "diatomic oxide", "pure oxygen", "o element", "atomic number 8", "oxigen", "history of oxygen", "oxygen", "oxygyn", "oxygen atom", "atc code v03an01", "vital air", "oxygen partial pressure", "oxygen rings", "oxygen ion", "o\u2082", "active oxygen", "diatomic oxygen", "oxygen gas"], ["Eutrophication", "Hypertrophication", "Cultural eutrophication", "Nutrient loading", "Eutrofication", "Euthrophication", "eutrophication", "nutrient loading", "hypertrophication", "cultural eutrophication", "eutrofication", "euthrophication"], ["Great Barrier Reef", "Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area", "The Great Barrier Reef", "Douglas Shoal", "Great barrier reef", "Great Detached Reef", "Great barrier reef history", "douglas shoal", "great detached reef", "great barrier reef history", "great barrier reef", "great barrier reef world heritage area"], ["24,900 miles", "24 900 miles"]], "question_ids": ["tc_2957", "tc_2973", "tc_3016", "tc_3026", "tc_3039"], "topic": "Emoji Movie"}}

Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words.

The students met the presenters, Jenny Hanley, Mick Robertson, and Tommy Boyd, who shared their experiences and showed them how the show was produced.\n\nNext, the Magic School Bus transported the students to the animated world of Disney's 'Robin Hood'. They were amazed to see Robin Hood as a clever fox, leading his band of animal friends in their fight against injustice. The students learned about the importance of standing up for what's right and helping those in need.\n\nAs the journey continued, the Magic School Bus took the students to a recording studio where they met Neil Morrissey, the voice behind Bob The Builder's hit song \"Can We Fix It?\". Neil taught the students about the process of recording a song and the importance of teamwork.\n\nThe students' next stop was the set of the film Superman, where they learned about the world of acting and filmmaking. They were surprised to discover that Marlon Brando had received 4 million dollars for his 10 minutes on screen in the film. This sparked a discussion about the value of time and the importance of making the most of every moment.\n\nFinally, the Magic School Bus brought the students to a cricket match, where they learned about the game's rules and terminology. When the score reached 111, the students discovered that this was called a \"Nelson.\" They enjoyed watching the match and learning about the history and traditions of cricket.\n\nAs the day came to an end, the students returned to their classroom, grateful for the exciting and educational adventure they had experienced on the Magic School Bus."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "spp_profile", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which ITV magazine style show ran from 1968 to 1980 and featured presenters including Jenny Hanley, Mick Robertson and Tommy Boyd?", "Which type of animal was Robin Hood in the Disney cartoon film 'Robin Hood'?", "Who provided the voice for Bob The Builder on his number one hit Can We Fix It?", "Which actor received 4 million dollars for his 10 minutes on screen in the film Superman?", "In cricket, what is the score of 111 known as?"], "answers": [["Chatterpie", "Magpie", "Magpies", "magpie", "magpies", "chatterpie"], ["Vulpine", "Vixen", "Todde", "Vulpini", "Fox", "Foxes", "Fox penis", "River fox", "Fox habitat", "Focks", "Foxp", "Fox (zoology)", "Foxs", "Sexual characteristics of foxes", "fox habitat", "vulpini", "focks", "foxs", "vulpine", "fox zoology", "sexual characteristics of foxes", "foxes", "fox penis", "foxp", "vixen", "todde", "fox", "river fox"], ["Neil morisey", "Neil Morrisy", "Neil A.

Boris was no ordinary spider; he was a magical creature who could grant wishes.\n\nPrincess Bride, being a fan of The Who, recognized Boris from their song and decided to ask for a wish. She wished for the most memorable wedding celebration the kingdom had ever seen. Boris agreed to grant her wish, but only if she could answer five questions about the world outside the kingdom.\n\nThe first question was about a famous actor from Eastenders. Princess Bride, being a fan of TV shows, knew that Nick Berry had played the policeman Nick Rowan. The second question was about the type of animal Boris was. Having met Boris, she knew he was a spider.\n\nThe third question was about the brand of beer that Homer Simpson, a beloved character in the kingdom, drank regularly. Princess Bride knew that Homer loved Duff beer. The fourth question was about the film in which the song White Christmas was first sung. As a fan of classic films, Princess Bride knew it was Holiday Inn.\n\nThe final question was about a Pop Idol who had a number one hit in 2004 called All This Time. Princess Bride, being a music enthusiast, knew it was Michelle McManus. Having answered all the questions correctly, Boris granted her wish.\n\nOn the day of the wedding, the kingdom was filled with joy and laughter. The celebration was unforgettable, with a live performance by Michelle McManus and a special appearance by Nick Berry.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct.

They are typically found in soil and can be agricultural pests.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the information! Here's my initial attempt at the story:\n\nIn the bustling city of St. Moritz, Switzerland, a grand Bakugan tournament was taking place. Dan Kuso and his powerful Bakugan, Drago, were preparing for their next match. As they walked through the city, they stumbled upon the famous Cresta Run, where athletes were practicing the thrilling sport of skeleton.\n\nSuddenly, a mysterious challenger appeared, claiming to have a Bakugan inspired by the legendary actress Pamela Anderson's character in the movie Barb Wire.

Inspired by their bravery, the trolls decided to embark on an adventure to the human world.\n\nThe trolls arrived in France, where they learned about the great leader General Charles de Gaulle and his successor, Georges Pompidou. They admired the French people's love for their country and decided to explore further.\n\nIn their journey, the trolls stumbled upon a costume shop, just like the one Mr. Benn used to visit for his adventures. They decided to disguise themselves as humans and entered the shop. Each troll picked a costume that represented a famous historical figure, making them almost unrecognizable.\n\nAs they continued their adventure, the trolls discovered the process of making cheese. They learned about rennet, the enzyme added to milk to create curds and whey. Intrigued by the process, they decided to bring the knowledge back to their magical land to share with their fellow trolls.\n\nFinally, the trolls arrived in London, where they marveled at the city's history and innovation. They were particularly fascinated by the first escalators installed in 1898 at Harrods department store. The trolls couldn't believe how far human technology had come since then.\n\nWith newfound appreciation for human history and culture, the trolls returned to their magical land, eager to share their experiences and the lessons they had learned."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "spp_profile", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["How were Dr Stantz, Dr Spengler and Dr Venkman better known in the 1980's?", "General Charles de Gaulle was French President 1959 to 1969.

Inside, they met a wise bartender who offered them a refreshing drink called the \"Cuba Libre,\" made with rum. The drink revitalized their spirits, and the bartender shared valuable information about the wand's location.\n\nWith renewed energy, the team continued their quest and encountered a group of skilled warriors who called themselves the \"Supermarine Spitfires.\" These warriors were named after the famous aircraft, the Spitfire, produced by the Supermarine company. They challenged Po and the Furious Five to a friendly match, with the winner gaining access to the hidden chamber where the wand was kept.\n\nDuring the intense battle, Po found inspiration in the lyrics of an old song he remembered, \"Always sunny in a rich man's world,\" from \"Money, Money, Money\" by ABBA. This reminded him that even in the darkest times, there's always hope. With this newfound motivation, Po and the Furious Five emerged victorious.\n\nAs they entered the hidden chamber, they discovered a wall with inscriptions of past champions.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance!

Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Their first stop was the Khyber Pass, a 33-mile-long mountain pass connecting Afghanistan and Pakistan. Lilo and Stitch were amazed by the rugged beauty of the landscape and the rich history of the region.\n\nNext, they traveled to Drury Lane in London, where they met the ghost of Nell Gwynn, who told them stories about her life as a mistress of King Charles II and how she used to sell oranges in the area. Lilo and Stitch were fascinated by the tales of old London and enjoyed tasting the sweet oranges.\n\nTheir journey continued to Liverpool, where they found themselves in the world of 'Wuthering Heights.' They met Catherine and Heathcliffe, who shared their tragic love story. Lilo and Stitch were moved by the tale and learned about the importance of love and forgiveness.\n\nFinally, they arrived in South Korea just in time for the country's first Formula One Grand Prix motor race in October 2010. Lilo and Stitch cheered on the racers and were thrilled by the speed and excitement of the event.\n\nAfter their incredible journey, Lilo and Stitch returned home to Hawaii, grateful for the new experiences and knowledge they had gained."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 3, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "spp_profile", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In computers, the X-Y Position Indicator for a Display System is now known as what?", "The Khyber Pass is approximately how many miles long?", "Which fruit did Nell Gwynn, mistress of King Charles II, sell in Drury Lane?", "In the novel \u2018Wuthering Heights\u2019 by Emily Bronte, Catherine\u2019s father found Heathcliffe on the streets of which English city?", "Which Asian country hosted its first Formula One Grand Prix motor race in October 2010?"], "answers": [["Cursor", "Cursor (disambiguation)", "Cursers", "Cursors", "Curser", "cursors", "cursor", "cursor disambiguation", "cursers", "curser"], ["33Miles", "33 Miles", "33miles", "33miles", "33 miles"], ["Orange fruit", "Xa Doai orange", "X\u00e3 \u0110o\u00e0i orange", "Appelsina", "Sweet Orange", "Orange (botany)", "Oranges", "Orange (flavor)", "Orange(fruit)", "Appels\u00edna", "Navel orange", "Orange (citrus)", "Culture of orange", "Sweet oranges", "Sweet orange", "Navel Orange", "Orange (fruit)", "appels\u00edna", "x\u00e3 \u0111o\u00e0i orange", "sweet orange", "xa doai orange", "appelsina", "navel orange", "oranges", "orange flavor", "sweet oranges", "orange botany", "orange citrus", "culture of orange", "orange fruit"], ["Liverpudlian", "Liverpudlians", "Liverpool, UK", "Liverpool (borough)", "Liverpool, Britain", "Metropolitan Borough of Liverpool", "The weather in Liverpool", "Liverpool (England)", "Liverpool/Archive 1", "Lerpwl", "County Borough of Liverpool", "Liverpool", "Scouseland", "Liverpool, Merseyside", "Landmarks in Liverpool", "Liverpool, England", "L'POOL", "Liverpool, U.K.", "liverpool england", "liverpool britain", "liverpool borough", "county borough of liverpool", "liverpool", "liverpool uk", "liverpool u k", "liverpool archive 1", "scouseland", "liverpool merseyside", "liverpudlians", "metropolitan borough of liverpool", "l pool", "lerpwl", "landmarks in liverpool", "liverpudlian", "weather in liverpool"], ["Nam Chosun", "Korea, Republic Of", "So.

One day, he stumbled upon a mysterious book lying on the forest floor. The book was written by a famous author from South Africa named J.R.R. Tolkien. Intrigued, Bambi decided to read the book and learn about the world beyond the forest.\n\nAs Bambi read, he discovered a story about a legendary horse race commentator named Peter O'Sullevan. Peter was known for his captivating voice, which brought excitement to every horse race he covered for the BBC. Bambi was fascinated by the idea of horse racing and wondered if he could ever be as fast as those majestic creatures.\n\nContinuing his journey, Bambi came across a group of animals playing music together. They called themselves \"The Forest Smiths\" and were inspired by a human band called The Smiths, who had released an album in 1986 entitled 'The Queen is Dead.' Bambi enjoyed their music and even learned a few dance moves from his new friends.\n\nOne day, Bambi met a wise old owl who told him about a place called Downing Street, where humans lived and made important decisions. The owl mentioned that a British Prime Minister named Margaret Thatcher had once called Downing Street 'One of the most precious jewels in the national heritage.' Bambi was amazed by the importance of this place and wondered what it would be like to visit.\n\nAs Bambi's adventures continued, he encountered a group of animals performing a play. The play was called 'The Winter's Tale,' written by the famous playwright William Shakespeare. Bambi was particularly interested in the character of Antigonus, who faced many challenges throughout the story. Bambi felt inspired by Antigonus's bravery and decided to face his own challenges with courage and determination."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "spp_profile", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Author J.R.R.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.
