One day, a tornado swept through their farm and carried Dorothy away to a magical land called Oz.\n\nIn Oz, Dorothy met a scarecrow, a tin man, and a cowardly lion who joined her on her journey to meet the Wizard of Oz. The Wizard of Oz was said to have the power to send Dorothy back home to her aunt and uncle.\n\nOn their journey, they encountered many obstacles, including a wicked witch who wanted to stop them from reaching the Wizard of Oz. But with the help of her new friends, Dorothy was able to defeat the witch and continue on her journey.\n\nAs they traveled through the land of Oz, they came across a town called La Cage Aux Folles. It was a town known for its extravagant and colorful performances. The group stopped to watch a show and were amazed by the talent and energy of the performers.\n\nEventually, they reached the Wizard of Oz and asked for his help to send Dorothy back home. The Wizard of Oz agreed to help, but only if they brought him the broomstick of the wicked witch.\n\nDorothy and her friends were able to retrieve the broomstick and bring it back to the Wizard of Oz. He kept his promise and sent Dorothy back home to her aunt and uncle.\n\nAs Dorothy returned home, she couldn't help but wonder about the percentage of the earth's surface covered by Europe. She also remembered reading about the founders of United Artists and how one of them had a last name nearest the beginning of the alphabet. She realized that her journey to Oz had taught her so much about the world and its wonders.\n\nAnd so, Dorothy lived happily ever after, always remembering her adventures in the magical land of Oz and the European town that gave its name to a Treaty symbolizing closer economic links between European countries."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 0, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt35-turbo", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "mtutor-openai-dev", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 3999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In which country was Earl Spencer's acrimonious divorce settlement heard?", "Which of the founders of United Artists had the last name nearest the beginning of the alphabet?", "In La Cage Aux Folles, what was La Cage Aux Folles?", "What percentage of the earth's surface is covered by Europe?", "Which European town gave its name to a Treaty which symbolizes closer economic links between European countries?"], "answers": [["South africa", "South Africa's", "Southafrica", "Third Republic (South Africa)", "Republiek van Suid-Afrika", "Sou'frica", "Zuid Afrika", "Zuid-Afrika", "ISO 3166-1:ZA", "South-African", "S Africa", "Zuid Africa", "Mzansi", "Afrique du sud", "Zuidafrika", "Ningizimu Afrika", "Capital of South Africa", "Suid-Afrika", "South-Africa", "Rep. of SOUTH AFRICA", "The Republic of South Africa", "Suid Africa", "Azania/South Africa", "S Afr", "Saffa", "South African", "Seth efrika", "South Africa", "Soufrica", "Republic of south africa", "South Africa\u00e0", "The Beloved Country", "S.

As he was settling in, he turned on the TV and saw that the Live Aid concert was being held in Philadelphia, USA. He watched as some of the biggest names in music performed to raise money for famine relief in Africa.\n\nAs the night wore on, the Grinch started to feel tired. He decided to take a nap, but before he did, he thought about the longest moon landing in history. He couldn't remember the exact length, but he knew it was a significant amount of time.\n\nWith that thought in his head, the Grinch drifted off to sleep, dreaming of all the mischief he could cause in the future."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 3, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt35-turbo", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "mtutor-openai-dev", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 3999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["\"Who said, To err is human but it feels divine?\"\"\"", "Which singer had a big 60s No 1 with Roses Are Red?", "What are the international registration letters of a vehicle from Iceland?", "Where was the American venue of the Live Aid concert?", "Which was the longest moon landing?"], "answers": [["Mae West", "Mae west", "Is that a gun in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me%3F", "When I'm Bad, I'm Better", "Jane Mast", "When I'm good, I'm very good...", "Mae West filmography", "mae west filmography", "is that gun in your pocket or are you just happy to see me 3f", "mae west", "when i m bad i m better", "when i m good i m very good", "jane mast"], ["Bobby Vinton", "bobby vinton"], ["I S", "I.s.", "IS", "I.S.", "Is.", "IS (disambiguation)", "Is", "is", "i s", "is disambiguation"], ["Philedelphia", "City of brotherly love", "City of Brotherly Love", "The Quaker City", "Philadelphia", "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.", "Philadelphia, Pa.", "List of nicknames for Philadelphia", "Philidalphia", "Philadelphia, United States", "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.", "Philadelphia PA", "Philadelphia Suburban Rail", "Philadelphi", "Philadelphia, U.S.", "Philadelphia Regional Rail", "The City of Brotherly Love", "City of Philadelphia", "Philadelphia (Pennsylvania)", "Wiccacoa", "Philadelpia, Pennsylvania", "Philadelphia, USA", "Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania", "Government of Philadelphia", "Philadelphia (PA)", "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA", "Philadelphia (City)", "UN/LOCODE:USPHL", "The City That Loves You Back", "Philadelphia (Pa.)", "Phila.", "The Cradle of Liberty", "The city of brotherly love", "Philadelphia (city, Pennsylvania)", "Philidelphia", "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, US", "Philadelphia Commuter Rail", "The City and County of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Philadephia, Pennsylvania", "Philadelphia City", "Philadelphia Pennsylvania", "Philadelphia City Controller", "Philladelphia", "Political families of Philadelphia", "Philadelphia, Pa", "Philadelphia, PA", "The Birthplace of America", "Philadelpia, PA", "birthplace of america", "philadelpia pa", "philadelphia pennsylvania u s", "un locode usphl", "philadephia pennsylvania", "government of philadelphia", "city and county of philadelphia pennsylvania", "philidelphia", "philadelphia commuter rail", "philedelphia", "philladelphia", "philadelphia pa", "philadelpia pennsylvania", "philadelphia city", "philadelphia", "philadelphia pennsylvania us", "philadelphia pennsylvania", "political families of philadelphia", "philadelphia regional rail", "list of nicknames for philadelphia", "philadelphi", "phila", "philadelphia u s", "philadelphia suburban rail", "cradle of liberty", "philidalphia", "philadelphia usa", "city that loves you back", "philadelphia city pennsylvania", "city of brotherly love", "wiccacoa", "philadelphia united states", "philadelphia philadelphia county pennsylvania", "philadelphia city controller", "quaker city", "city of philadelphia", "philadelphia pennsylvania usa"], ["Apollo 17", "Apollo XVII", "Apollo17", "apollo xvii", "apollo17", "apollo 17"]], "question_ids": ["tc_2182", "tc_2191", "tc_2202", "tc_2208", "tc_2218"], "topic": "Grinch"}}

They decided to settle the argument by asking their AI assistant, who quickly informed them that it was actually Celtic FC.\n\nAs they continued to watch the game, they decided to play a game of dominoes to pass the time during halftime. They were surprised to learn that a standard set of dominoes has 28 pieces. They played a few rounds, but eventually got distracted by a news report about the first animals sent into space. They were shocked to learn that Benjy and Laska, two dogs, were sent into space in 1958.\n\nAfter the game, the Flintstones decided to take the London Underground to visit some friends. They were determined to ride on the line that connects at some point with every other line on the system. They quickly realized that the only line that does this is the Circle Line. They hopped on the train and enjoyed the ride, marveling at the intricate network of tunnels and lines that make up the London Underground.\n\nAs they arrived at their destination, they couldn't help but think about Thomas Edison, who invented the lightbulb. They remembered reading that he was afraid of the dark, which seemed ironic given his invention. They chuckled at the thought and went to enjoy their visit with their friends."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 2, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt35-turbo", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "mtutor-openai-dev", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 3999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What was the first British football team to win the European Cup?", "How many pieces are there in a standard set of dominoes?", "What were Benjy and Laska, which were sent into space in 1958?", "On the London Underground, which is the only line to connect at some point with every other line on the system?", "Thomas Edison, who invented the lightbulb, was afraid of the dark?"], "answers": [["Celtic", "Celtic (Disambiguation)", "Celtic (disambiguation)", "Celto-", "Celto", "Keltic", "keltic", "celtic disambiguation", "celtic", "celto"], ["28", "twenty-eight", "twenty eight", "28"], ["\ud83d\udc01", "Mouse subgenus", "Reproductive behavior of mice", "Mouse (animal)", "MOUSE", "Mouse (rodent)", "\ud83d\udc2d", "Mus (genus)", "Mice", "Mouse", "mouse", "reproductive behavior of mice", "\ud83d\udc2d", "mouse rodent", "mouse animal", "mice", "mouse subgenus", "mus genus", "\ud83d\udc01"], ["Jubilee line", "Fleet Line", "The Jubilee Line", "Jubilee Line", "Fleet line", "jubilee line", "fleet line"], ["True (disambiguation)", "True", "True (album)", "TRUE (Album)", "True (song)", "TRUE", "True (Album)", "Truer", "true song", "true disambiguation", "truer", "true", "true album"]], "question_ids": ["qz_148", "qz_196", "qz_250", "qz_298", "qz_347"], "topic": "Flintstones"}}

He spent most of his free time practicing and perfecting his Beyblade skills. One day, while browsing through his grandfather's old magazines, he stumbled upon an article about the Italian fashion designer, Gianni Versace, who was shot dead on the steps of his Miami mansion in 1997.\n\nMax was intrigued by the story and decided to do some research on Versace. He learned that Versace was famous for his bold and colorful designs, and was loved by many celebrities, including Madonna. In fact, Versace designed Madonna's wedding dress for her marriage to Guy Ritchie.\n\nAs Max continued his research, he also discovered that another famous fashion designer, Coco Chanel, was known for popularizing the 'little black dress' in the 1920s. Max was fascinated by the history of fashion and how it had evolved over time.\n\nIn between his research, Max also enjoyed watching his favorite TV show, E.R. He was a big fan of George Clooney, who played Dr. Doug Ross on the show. Max admired Dr. Ross's dedication to his patients and his ability to remain calm under pressure.\n\nOne day, Max's friend Kate came over to visit. Kate was a big fan of the 1990 film Mermaids and loved the character Kate Flax, played by Winona Ryder.

He learned that Versace was famous for his bold and colorful designs, and was loved by many celebrities, including Madonna.

He was a big fan of George Clooney, who played Dr. Doug Ross on the show. Max admired Dr. Ross's dedication to his patients and his ability to remain calm under pressure.\n\nOne day, Max's friend Kate came over to visit.

He was a street urchin who dreamed of a better life. One day, while wandering the marketplace, he stumbled upon a magical lamp. Rubbing it, he released a genie who granted him three wishes.\n\nFor his first wish, Aladdin asked for wealth and power. The genie granted his wish, and Aladdin became the richest man in Agrabah. With his newfound wealth, he set out to explore the world.\n\nDuring his travels, Aladdin came across a group of actors performing a play. The play was \"The Tempest\" by William Shakespeare, which tells the story of Prospero, the rightful Duke of Milan. Aladdin was captivated by the story and watched the play several times.\n\nAs he continued his journey, Aladdin came across a military airfield where he saw the Panavia Tornado, a fighter-bomber built by the Panavia partnership. He was fascinated by the aircraft and spent hours watching it take off and land.\n\nEventually, Aladdin returned to Agrabah and reunited with his true love, Jasmine. They spent the holidays together, and on the Sixth Day of Christmas, Jasmine brought him six geese a-laying.\n\nAs the new year began, Aladdin decided to pursue his passion for gymnastics. He trained hard and eventually competed in the 2012 London Olympics, where he won a silver medal in the pommel horse discipline, just like Louis Smith.\n\nAladdin's adventures had taken him far and wide, but in the end, he realized that the greatest treasure was the love of his family and friends.
