She is a big fan of literature and movies and enjoys learning new things. In her latest adventure, she visits a remote island where she discovers some interesting facts about the history of the place. Along the way, she encounters some challenges and meets some fascinating people who help her on her journey.\n\nStory:\nElsa had always dreamed of traveling the world and experiencing new cultures. She was a wealthy woman who had made her fortune in the tech industry, and she loved to indulge in her passion for literature and movies whenever she had the chance.\n\nOn her latest adventure, Elsa decided to visit a remote island in the Pacific Ocean. She had heard that the island was home to some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, and she was eager to explore the area.\n\nAs she arrived on the island, Elsa was struck by its natural beauty. The crystal-clear waters and white sandy beaches were breathtaking, and she couldn't wait to start exploring.\n\nOne of the first things Elsa did was to visit the local library. She was a big fan of literature and was curious to see what books the library had to offer. As she browsed the shelves, she came across a copy of the stage show \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" which featured the hit song \"If I Were A Rich Man.\"\n\nElsa was delighted to find the book and decided to take it with her on her travels. She also discovered that the library had two sequels to the famous novel \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" called \"Men Against the Sea\" and \"Pitcairn's Island.\"\n\nAs Elsa continued her exploration of the island, she met a local historian who told her about Truman Capote's last name before he was adopted by his stepfather. She also learned about Lewis Carroll's poem \"The Hunting of the Snark\" and how the elusive, troublesome snark turned into a boojum to fool hunters.\n\nOne day, Elsa decided to take a hike up to the highest point on the island. As she reached the summit, she was reminded of the Bible story of Joshua, where the sun and moon stood still before him.\n\nOn her way back down the mountain, Elsa heard the Coolio song \"Gangsta's Paradise\" playing from a nearby house.

She was a wealthy woman who had made her fortune in the tech industry, and she loved to indulge in her passion for literature and movies whenever she had the chance.\n\nOn her latest adventure, Elsa decided to visit a remote island in the Pacific Ocean. She had heard that the island was home to some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, and she was eager to explore the area.\n\nAs she arrived on the island, Elsa was struck by its natural beauty. The crystal-clear waters and white sandy beaches were breathtaking, and she couldn't wait to start exploring.\n\nOne of the first things Elsa did was to visit the local library. She was a big fan of literature and was curious to see what books the library had to offer. As she browsed the shelves, she came across a copy of the stage show \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" which featured the hit song \"If I Were A Rich Man.\"\n\nElsa was delighted to find the book and decided to take it with her on her travels. She also discovered that the library had two sequels to the famous novel \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" called \"Men Against the Sea\" and \"Pitcairn's Island.\"\n\nAs Elsa continued her exploration of the island, she met a local historian who told her about Truman Capote's last name before he was adopted by his stepfather. She also learned about Lewis Carroll's poem \"The Hunting of the Snark\" and how the elusive, troublesome snark turned into a boojum to fool hunters.\n\nOne day, Elsa decided to take a hike up to the highest point on the island. As she reached the summit, she was reminded of the Bible story of Joshua, where the sun and moon stood still before him.\n\nOn her way back down the mountain, Elsa heard the Coolio song \"Gangsta's Paradise\" playing from a nearby house. She remembered that the song was featured in the Michelle Pfeiffer movie \"Dangerous Minds.\"\n\nAs her trip came to an end, Elsa reflected on all the new things she had learned.

Woody felt threatened by Buzz's popularity and tried to get rid of him.\n\nMeanwhile, in the real world, it was 1993 and Yitzhak Rabin became Israel's head of state. In WWII, Reinhard Heydrich was the head of the Nazi party's security service. Back in the toy world, Woody's jealousy led to a series of misadventures, including getting lost at a gas station in Texas, the state on the Gulf of Mexico nearest the end of the alphabet. \n\nWoody and Buzz eventually found their way back to their owner's house, but not before encountering some obstacles. They even had to make a stop at Truax Field international airport in Wisconsin to catch a ride back home. Along the way, they learned to work together and became friends.\n\nIn the 1904 Olympics, Americans won 23 out of 25 track and field titles, showing their dominance in the sport. The Black Hills, where Woody and Buzz found themselves lost, lie between the Cheyenne and Belle Fourche rivers.\n\nAs the toys made their way back home, they watched the first in-flight movie shown on an internal flight in the USA, which happened in 1961. They also heard about Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey Oswald in November 1963 and Chuck Yeager becoming the first American to travel faster than the speed of sound.\n\nWhen Woody and Buzz finally made it back to their owner's room, they were greeted with open arms. Their adventure had taught them valuable lessons about friendship and teamwork. And in the real world, Barbara Walters had already interviewed Richard Nixon, the first US president she ever interviewed."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 6,

The Incredibles were surprised to see the fastest animal on two legs being used as a mode of transportation.\n\nAfter successfully apprehending the thieves, the Incredibles took a moment to appreciate the surrounding nature. They noticed some mosses growing on a nearby tree and realized that they belonged to the plant kingdom Bryophyta.\n\nAs they made their way back home, they saw a squirrel carrying its young to a drey. They also passed by a beaver dam, where they learned that the mammal constructs a lodge in which to store food, rear young, and pass the winter.\n\nWhen they arrived home, they noticed some aquatic plants growing in their pond. Jack-Jack, who was fascinated by everything, asked what they were called. Elastigirl explained that they were called aquatic plants, which grow in water or water-logged conditions.\n\nFinally, as they were winding down for the day, Mr. Incredible remembered a fact he had learned in his anatomy class.

As they were chasing the thieves through the city, they came across a glass factory. Mr. Incredible noticed that the raw material used for making glass was silica, which he remembered from his high school chemistry class.\n\nAs they continued their pursuit, they came across a fountain where the water was rapidly evaporating due to the hot sun. Violet, who had recently learned about the change of state from liquid to gas in her science class, pointed out the phenomenon to her family.\n\nWhen they finally caught up to the thieves, they found that they had used complex mathematical calculations to plan their heist. Dash, who was a math whiz, quickly figured out their plan using the four fundamental principles of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nThe thieves had a getaway vehicle waiting for them, which turned out to be an ostrich. The Incredibles were surprised to see the fastest animal on two legs being used as a mode of transportation.\n\nAfter successfully apprehending the thieves, the Incredibles took a moment to appreciate the surrounding nature. They noticed some mosses growing on a nearby tree and realized that they belonged to the plant kingdom Bryophyta.\n\nAs they made their way back home, they saw a squirrel carrying its young to a drey. They also passed by a beaver dam, where they learned that the mammal constructs a lodge in which to store food, rear young, and pass the winter.\n\nWhen they arrived home, they noticed some aquatic plants growing in their pond. Jack-Jack, who was fascinated by everything, asked what they were called. Elastigirl explained that they were called aquatic plants, which grow in water or water-logged conditions.\n\nFinally, as they were winding down for the day, Mr. Incredible remembered a fact he had learned in his anatomy class. He explained to his family that when the egg is released from the ovary, the follicle is left behind. Violet was intrigued and asked what the scientific name for the heart's pacemaker was. Mr. Incredible replied that it was the sinoatrial node.

As she dozed off, she found herself falling down a rabbit hole and into Wonderland. Confused and disoriented, she stumbled upon a talking zebra named Stripes who offered to help her navigate this strange new world.\n\nAs they walked through the fantastical landscape, they stumbled upon a horse race. Stripes explained that the star of the 2005 film Racing Stripes was a zebra just like him. Alice was fascinated and Stripes recommended she read some of Dick Francis' novels, which were based around horse racing.\n\nContinuing on their journey, they came across a Scottish newspaper featuring the Broons and Oor Wullie. Alice was intrigued by the Scottish culture and asked Stripes to tell her more about it. They then heard a Christmas song playing in the distance, with the line \"It seems so long since I could say 'sister Susie sitting on a thistle'\". Stripes explained that it was a popular holiday tune in Wonderland.\n\nAs they walked further, they stumbled upon a group of football players. Stripes explained that the British footballer with the most international caps was Peter Shilton. They then encountered a band with a trumpet player and discussed Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles.\n\nAs they continued their journey, they heard a song about the taxman taking all the dough. Stripes explained that it was a popular song in Wonderland and they sang along. They then visited the pub where George Cornell was shot by the Kray twins in 1966.\n\nFinally, they heard the Pink Panther theme and Stripes explained that it was composed by Henry Mancini. Alice was impressed and asked Stripes if he knew any other interesting facts. He then told her that actress Meg Ryan had married Dennis Quaid on Valentine's Day in 1991.\n\nAlice was grateful for Stripes' help and knowledge as they continued their journey through Wonderland."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt35-turbo", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "mtutor-openai-dev", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 3999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What type of animal is the star of the 2005 film Racing Stripes?", "Author Dick Francis is famous for writing novels based around which sport?", "Which Scottish newspaper features the Broons and Oor Wullie?", "Which Christmas song includes the line It seems so long since I could say 'sister Susie sitting on a thistle'?", "Which British footballer has the most number of International caps?", "Who holds a trumpet on the album cover of Sgt.

George Jetson worked at Spacely Space Sprockets, a company that produced space-age gadgets. One day, while George was at work, he received a call from his wife, Jane, who was excitedly telling him about a new movie she had just watched. \"It was a classic,\" she said, \"starring the Great Lover of the Silent Screen, Rudolph Valentino.\"\n\nGeorge was intrigued and decided to watch the movie himself. As he was watching, he noticed that one of the actors looked familiar. It was Tommy Lee Jones, who had played Cate Blanchett's father in \"The Missing\", a story set in 19th century New Mexico where the father worked with his estranged daughter to get her kidnapped child back.\n\nGeorge was impressed with Jones' performance and decided to look up some of his other movies. He discovered that Jodie Foster had won the Best Actress Oscar for \"The Accused\", a movie that dealt with a difficult subject matter.\n\nAs George continued his research, he came across some interesting facts. For example, he learned that the Fleet River, which now flows underground, rises in Hampstead, flows through St. Pancras, down Farringdon Street and enters the Thames by Blackfriars Bridge. He also discovered that Fred Astaire had only one notable film cameo, appearing with Sean Connery in the 1979 movie \"The First Great Train Robbery\", breaking into a guarded station office.\n\nGeorge was fascinated by all the information he was learning and decided to quiz his family. He asked his wife, Jane, what the first name of the character played by John Travolta in \"Saturday Night Fever\" was. She answered correctly, \"Tony\". He then asked his son, Elroy, in which 1969 movie Michael Caine appeared with his brother Stanley. Elroy answered, \"The Italian Job\".\n\nFinally, George asked his daughter, Judy, where the Rolling Stones concert was held in 1969 where a man was stabbed to death by a member of the Hell's Angels. Judy answered, \"Altamont Speedway\".\n\nAs George was wrapping up his trivia quiz, he remembered one last fact. It takes approximately 8 minutes for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth. He shared this with his family, who were all impressed with his newfound knowledge.\n\nTo celebrate, Jane made a delicious dinner of anellini pasta, which is ring-shaped.

George Jetson worked at Spacely Space Sprockets, a company that produced space-age gadgets. One day, while George was at work, he received a call from his wife, Jane, who was excitedly telling him about a new movie she had just watched. \"It was a classic,\" she said, \"starring the Great Lover of the Silent Screen, Rudolph Valentino.\"\n\nGeorge was intrigued and decided to watch the movie himself. As he was watching, he noticed that one of the actors looked familiar. It was Tommy Lee Jones, who had played Cate Blanchett's father in \"The Missing\", a story set in 19th century New Mexico where the father worked with his estranged daughter to get her kidnapped child back.\n\nGeorge was impressed with Jones' performance and decided to look up some of his other movies. He discovered that Jodie Foster had won the Best Actress Oscar for \"The Accused\", a movie that dealt with a difficult subject matter.\n\nAs George continued his research, he came across some interesting facts. For example, he learned that the Fleet River, which now flows underground, rises in Hampstead, flows through St. Pancras, down Farringdon Street and enters the Thames by Blackfriars Bridge. He also discovered that Fred Astaire had only one notable film cameo, appearing with Sean Connery in the 1979 movie \"The First Great Train Robbery\", breaking into a guarded station office.\n\nGeorge was fascinated by all the information he was learning and decided to quiz his family. He asked his wife, Jane, what the first name of the character played by John Travolta in \"Saturday Night Fever\" was. She answered correctly, \"Tony\". He then asked his son, Elroy, in which 1969 movie Michael Caine appeared with his brother Stanley. Elroy answered, \"The Italian Job\".\n\nFinally, George asked his daughter, Judy, where the Rolling Stones concert was held in 1969 where a man was stabbed to death by a member of the Hell's Angels. Judy answered, \"Altamont Speedway\".\n\nAs George was wrapping up his trivia quiz, he remembered one last fact. It takes approximately 8 minutes for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth. He shared this with his family, who were all impressed with his newfound knowledge.\n\nTo celebrate, Jane made a delicious dinner of anellini pasta, which is ring-shaped.

One day, while digging in his backyard, he stumbled upon an old parchment that looked like a treasure map. Wiggles was thrilled! He had always dreamed of going on a treasure hunt, just like the heroes in his favorite adventure stories.\n\nThe map was old and faded, but Wiggles could make out some of the landmarks. It seemed to lead to a small island in the middle of a river. Wiggles had never been on a boat before, but he was determined to find the treasure. He set out on his journey, with a backpack full of snacks and a sense of adventure in his heart.\n\nAs he crossed the river, Wiggles remembered a fascinating fact he had learned from his human friend. In 1216, English monarch King John was said to have lost the crown jewels while crossing the same body of water. Wiggles wondered if he would find any treasure on this island.\n\nWhen he arrived on the island, Wiggles started exploring. He climbed trees, dug holes, and sniffed around for clues. Suddenly, he heard a voice calling out to him. It was a friendly old man who lived on the island. The man told Wiggles that he knew about the treasure and would help him find it.\n\nAs they walked together, the old man asked Wiggles some trivia questions to keep him entertained. He asked, \"What is the nickname of baseball star Jimmie Foxx?\" Wiggles didn't know the answer, but the old man told him it was \"Double X\" because of his powerful hitting.\n\nThey continued walking until they reached a beautiful old building. The old man told Wiggles that it was Westminster Abbey, where many famous people were buried. He asked Wiggles, \"Who was the first poet to be buried at Poet\u2019s Corner in London\u2019s Westminster Abbey?\" Wiggles didn't know the answer, but the old man told him it was Geoffrey Chaucer, the author of \"The Canterbury Tales.\"\n\nAs they walked back to the boat, the old man told Wiggles about his favorite children's author, Roald Dahl. He asked Wiggles, \"Who was the illustrator for most of Roald Dahl\u2019s stories for children?\" Wiggles didn't know the answer, but the old man told him it was Quentin Blake, who created the iconic illustrations for \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" and many other books.\n\nWiggles was having so much fun learning new things that he almost forgot about the treasure. But then the old man led him to a hidden spot and showed him a small chest. Inside, there were some old coins and a book.

The 1958 film adaptation of the book won several Academy Awards.\n\nAs they sailed back across the river, Wiggles felt proud of himself for finding the treasure and learning so much along the way. When he got home, he told his human friend all about his adventure. His friend was impressed and asked him some more trivia questions. He asked, \"Which US gangster was released from Alcatraz prison in November 1939?\" Wiggles didn't know the answer, but he was excited to learn more.

The Rangers helped Mr Rochester defeat Lord Zedd, who had taken the form of Bertha Mason.\n\nIn Kensington Gardens, they found the fifth and final piece of the sword, which was guarded by the bronze statue of Peter Pan, the fictional character created by J.M. Barrie. The Rangers defeated Lord Zedd and his minions in a final battle, using the Sword of Alexander the Great.\n\nAfter their mission was complete, the Rangers learned that the mask worn by the killer in the movie 'Scream' was based on the painting 'The Scream' by Edvard Munch.

Once again, the protagonist emerged victorious and moved on to the semifinals.\n\nIn the semifinals, the protagonist faced a player with Duane Syndrome, which affected their eye movements. Despite the opponent's challenges, the protagonist won the match and advanced to the finals.\n\nIn the finals, the protagonist faced a player with Taphephobia, who was afraid of being buried alive. The opponent's fear was reflected in their deck, which featured cards related to death and burial. However, the protagonist remained focused and emerged victorious, becoming the champion of the tournament.\n\nReflecting on their journey, the protagonist realized that they had faced opponents from diverse backgrounds and with unique challenges. From the Gilbert and Sullivan fan to the player from Syria, the opponent with Duane Syndrome, and the player with Taphephobia, each match had been a learning experience.

The story ends with Hiccup and Toothless flying off into the sunset.\n\nStory:\nHiccup was a young Viking who lived on the island of Berk. He had always dreamed of becoming a dragon trainer, but his father, the chief, didn't believe he had what it took. One day, Hiccup stumbled upon a wounded dragon, whom he named Toothless. He nursed the dragon back to health and soon discovered that Toothless was unlike any other dragon he had ever seen.\n\nHiccup knew he had to train Toothless to become a proper dragon, but he didn't know where to start. He sought advice from a wise old man who told him about the Greek philosopher, Diogenes, who lived inside a barrel. The old man explained that Diogenes believed in living a simple life and that Hiccup could learn a lot from his teachings.\n\nHiccup and Toothless set off on a journey to Tightwad, Missouri, to meet with a football player who had won the Best Young Player Award.

One day, he overheard some grasshoppers talking about the World Bog Snorkelling Championships, which were held annually in Wales. Flik was fascinated by the idea of snorkelling in a bog and decided to learn more about it.\n\nHe went to the colony's library and found a book about the largest known volcano in our solar system, which was on Mars. Flik was amazed by the pictures of the volcano and wondered what it would be like to explore it. He also read some books by Scottish physician and novelist A.J. Cronin, who created the character of Dr. Finlay. Flik was impressed by Dr. Finlay's dedication to helping his patients and decided to be more like him.\n\nFlik also learned that there are 17 double-word score squares on a standard Scrabble board and that the second James Bond film was called \"From Russia with Love\". He was curious about the founder of British company JCB, Joseph Cyril Bamford, and read about his life and achievements. Flik also read the Anna Sewell novel \"Black Beauty\" and was moved by the story of the horse's struggles and triumphs.\n\nAs Flik continued to learn, he discovered that American singer Al, late British television host Hughie, and British businessman Philip all shared the surname \"Green\". He also found out that the fictitious station of Walford East in the UK television series \"Eastenders\" replaced the real-life station of Bromley-by-Bow on the tube map. Finally, Flik read the 1975 novel \"The History Man\" by Malcolm Bradbury and was impressed by its satirical take on academia.\n\nFlik's newfound knowledge helped him become a better ant and a more valuable member of his colony. He also realized that there was so much more to learn and explore in the world beyond his colony. Flik was grateful for the opportunity to be an AI assistant that helps people find information, as it allowed him to continue learning and growing every day."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 10, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt35-turbo", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "mtutor-openai-dev", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 3999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["The World Bog Snorkelling Championships are held annually in which European country?", "The largest known volcano in our solar system is on which planet?", "Which Scottish physician and novelist created Dr Finlay?", "How many double-word score squares are there on a standard Scrabble board?", "What it the title of the second James Bond film, which opened in the UK in 1963?", "What were the names of the founder of British company JCB?", "In the Anna Sewell novel, what is Black Beauty?", "American singer Al, late British television host Hughie and British businessman Philip all share which surname?", "The fictitious station of Walford East, which features in the UK television series \u2018Eastenders\u2019, replaces which London Underground station on the tube map?", "Who wrote the 1975 novel \u2018The History Man\u2019?"], "answers": [["Welsh nation", "Climate of Wales", "Autonomous Province of Wales", "Cymru / wales", "Cyrmu", "Wales", "WALES", "Rain in Wales", "Welsh Nation", "Welsh Peninsula", "Wales, UK", "Etymology of Wales", "Cymru", "Wales, United Kingdom", "Pays de Galles", "Communications in Wales", "The Principality of Wales", "West of the Rhymney", "Wales, U.K.", "Cymru am byth", "Gymru", "Cymru / Wales", "Welsh mountains", "CYMRU", "principality of wales", "welsh mountains", "wales", "wales u k", "cyrmu", "etymology of wales", "communications in wales", "gymru", "cymru am byth", "autonomous province of wales", "welsh peninsula", "wales united kingdom", "pays de galles", "climate of wales", "cymru wales", "welsh nation", "rain in wales", "west of rhymney", "cymru", "wales uk"], ["Fourth planet", "Sol 4", "Mars surface features", "Mars", "Mars/Planet", "Hydrology of Mars", "Magnetosphere of Mars", "Marte (planet)", "Mars (planet)", "Sol-4", "2003 opposition of Mars", "4th planet", "Planet Mars", "Sun e", "Sol e", "Mars (Planet)", "Physical characteristics of Mars", "Mars opposition", "Sol IV", "Oblate Mars", "Opposition of Mars", "Mars orbit", "fourth planet", "mars", "oblate mars", "mars surface features", "4th planet", "marte planet", "2003 opposition of mars", "mars opposition", "hydrology of mars", "planet mars", "sol e", "opposition of mars", "sun e", "mars orbit", "physical characteristics of mars", "sol 4", "mars planet", "magnetosphere of mars", "sol iv"], ["Archibald Cronin", "A J Cronin", "A.J.

One day, her father stumbled upon a castle in the woods and decided to take a rose from the garden for his daughter. However, the owner of the castle, a beast, caught him and demanded that he either give him his daughter or stay in the castle forever.

He was actually quite kind and gentle, and they soon became friends. However, one day, a group of thieves broke into the castle and stole some valuable items, including a medal belonging to Rower Alex Partridge and hockey player Hannah Macleod.\n\nThe Beast was devastated by the theft and decided to take matters into his own hands. He recorded a 1964 single calling for John Lennon to be president, hoping that it would inspire people to be more honest and kind. However, the debate over the authorship of Shakespeare's works continued to rage on, with some claiming that it was actually an English peer and courtier who wrote them.\n\nAs Beauty and the Beast played a game of Scrabble, they counted the number of 'E' tiles provided and wondered if they had enough to spell out the name of the actor who played Gomez Addams in the 1993 film 'Addams Family Values'. They also discussed 'Black Wednesday' and its impact on the British government, as well as the exhumation of a US President to test for arsenic poisoning.\n\nOne day, after over 20 years of restoration work, a painting by Leonardo da Vinci was placed back on display in Milan. Beauty and the Beast marveled at its beauty and wondered if they could find a way to visit it someday. They also talked about the renaming of 'David and Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web' and how it had become such a valuable resource.\n\nAs they finished their game of Scrabble, Beauty and the Beast decided to take a walk through the village. They stumbled upon Ray's Jazz Cafe, situated inside a famous London bookshop, and decided to go inside. They listened to the music and talked about all the things they had learned and experienced together.\n\nIn the end, Beauty realized that the Beast was not a monster at all, but a kind and gentle soul who had been misunderstood.
