Woody, the cowboy doll, was the leader of the toys and was loved by all. However, when a new toy, Buzz Lightyear, arrived, Woody felt threatened and jealous. The two toys ended up getting lost and had to work together to find their way back home.\n\nAs they journeyed through the house, they encountered many obstacles, including a group of mischievous toys led by a toy soldier named Mase. Mase was known for his hit song \"Can't Hold Me Down,\" which he often sang while leading his toy army.\n\nMeanwhile, Woody and Buzz stumbled upon a book about famous mountain climbers and read about Edmond Hillary, who had been a beekeeper before taking up mountain climbing. They were fascinated by his story and wondered how he had made such a drastic career change.\n\nEventually, Woody and Buzz found themselves in a toy store where they met a friendly toy named Jennifer Aniston. She helped them escape the store and they made their way to the airport to catch a flight back home. As they boarded the plane, they noticed the airport was named Benina International Airport and realized they were in Libya.\n\nFinally, after a long journey, Woody and Buzz made it back to their owner's bedroom. They were greeted with open arms and were happy to be back where they belonged.

Sing wondered if there was any connection between the two questions and the murder case he was investigating.\n\nAs he delved deeper into the case, Sing discovered that the victim had been a history buff and was particularly interested in the only Prime Minister of Britain to be assassinated, Spencer Perceval. Sing wondered if the victim's interest in history had anything to do with the murder.\n\nSing's investigation led him to the chain of islands in the southwestern Philippines, where the victim had recently traveled. He discovered that the victim had been researching the history of the islands and had uncovered some information that could have led to his murder.\n\nAs Sing was piecing together the clues, he remembered another question he had come across. What was the name of the ferry that capsized after leaving Zeebrugge in 1987? The answer was the Herald of Free Enterprise. Sing realized that the name of the ferry was also the name of a company that the victim had been investigating.\n\nWith all the pieces of the puzzle falling into place, Sing was able to solve the case.

But Aladdin's greatest wish was to win the heart of Princess Jasmine, the beautiful daughter of the Sultan.\n\nWith the genie's help, Aladdin disguised himself as a wealthy prince and won Jasmine's heart. But their happiness was short-lived, as the evil Jafar, the Sultan's advisor, plotted to take over the kingdom. With the help of his friends, including a talking parrot named Iago, Aladdin set out to defeat Jafar and save the kingdom.\n\nIn the final battle, Aladdin used his quick wit and bravery to outsmart Jafar and save the day. As a reward for his heroism, the Sultan granted Aladdin permission to marry Jasmine and become the next ruler of Agrabah.\n\nAs they celebrated their victory, Aladdin and Jasmine sang a song about the Twelve Days of Christmas. Aladdin remembered that on the Sixth Day of Christmas, his true love had given him six geese a-laying. He also recalled that Prospero was a character in Shakespeare's play \"The Tempest,\" and that the Panavia Tornado was an RAF fighter-bomber. And as they laughed and joked, Aladdin couldn't help but quote one of his favorite catchphrases from the sitcom \"Only Fools and Horses\": \"Rodney, you plonka!\" Finally, they cheered for Louis Smith, who had won an individual silver medal in gymnastics for the pommel horse discipline at the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nAladdin knew that he had been blessed with good fortune, but he also knew that it was his kind heart and bravery that had brought him to this point. And as he looked out over his kingdom, he knew that he would always be grateful for the magic lamp that had changed his life forever."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt35-turbo", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "mtutor-openai-dev", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 3999, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which Shakespeare play tells the story of Prospero, the rightful Duke of Milan?", "Which RAF fighter-bomber was built by the Panavia partnership?", "\"Rodney you plonka\" and \"This time next year we'll be millionaires\" are catchphrases from which well-known television sitcom?", "What did my true love bring to me on the Sixth Day of Christmas?", "Louis Smith won an individual silver medal in gymnastics at the 2012 London Olympics.
