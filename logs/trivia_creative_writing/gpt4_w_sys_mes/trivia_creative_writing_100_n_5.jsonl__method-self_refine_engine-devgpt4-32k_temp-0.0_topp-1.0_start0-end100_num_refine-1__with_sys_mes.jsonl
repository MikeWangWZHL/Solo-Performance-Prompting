A villain named Baby Menace was causing chaos by turning adults into small children. Parents were struggling to keep up with their newly transformed little ones, and the city was in disarray.\n\nDuring this time, the Avengers discovered that in the late 60s, Owen Finlay MacLaren had pioneered a useful item for parents of small children: the collapsible baby stroller. They realized that this invention could help parents manage their transformed children while they searched for a way to defeat Baby Menace.\n\nAs the Avengers investigated Baby Menace's origins, they found a clue that led them to the city of Gdansk, Poland. It was in this city's shipyard that the Solidarity movement was set up, which played a significant role in the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. The team believed that Baby Menace's powers were somehow connected to this historical event.\n\nWhile in Gdansk, the Avengers encountered a mysterious woman who claimed to have information about Baby Menace. She introduced herself as Melody, a singer who shared the same birthday as impressionist Rich Little. Melody revealed that Baby Menace was once a normal child who had been exposed to a powerful energy source that granted him his unique abilities.\n\nWith this new information, the Avengers tracked down Baby Menace and discovered that he was a huge baseball fan. In fact, he was obsessed with the 1998 season when Mark McGwire broke Roger Maris' home run record. The team used this knowledge to their advantage, distracting Baby Menace with a holographic reenactment of the historic moment.\n\nAs Baby Menace was enthralled by the hologram, the Avengers managed to reverse the effects of his powers, turning the transformed adults back into their original forms.

Alice was excited to attend the event, but she needed to find a way to get there quickly.\n\nAs she pondered her options, the White Rabbit appeared and told her about a magical underground railway system that could take her to Reims in no time. This railway system, known as the London Underground, was the first of its kind in Europe, having opened in London at the beginning of the century. Alice, intrigued by the idea, decided to give it a try.\n\nUpon arriving in Reims, Alice was greeted by a familiar face - Mickey Mouse! She was surprised to learn that Mickey had been drawn by Ub Iwerks when Walt Disney first supplied the voice. Mickey was there to entertain the guests at the party, and Alice was delighted to have a friend by her side.\n\nAs the party commenced, Alice met a fascinating actress who had written a novel called The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles. This enchanting story was about a magical world filled with extraordinary creatures, and it was penned by the talented Julie Andrews. Alice and Julie quickly became friends, discussing their shared love for literature and storytelling.\n\nAs the night went on, Alice was introduced to the star of the film based on the record Harper Valley PTA by Jeannie C. Riley. Barbara Eden, the actress who played the lead role, shared her experiences and challenges in bringing the story to life on the big screen. The film was a comedic tale of a single mother standing up against the hypocrisy of a small town's Parent-Teacher Association.\n\nThe party in Reims was a night to remember, filled with laughter, dancing, and fascinating conversations. Alice felt grateful for the opportunity to meet such incredible people and learn about their unique stories. As the night came to an end, Alice knew that her adventures in Wonderland would continue to surprise and delight her, and she eagerly awaited her next extraordinary journey."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which home of champagne in France was also where the German High Command surrendered in WWII?", "Which was the first European city this century to open an underground railway system?", "Who first drew Mickey Mouse when ?Disney first supplied the voice?", "Which actress wrote the novel The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles?", "Who was the star of the film based on the record Harper Valley PTA by Jeannie C Riley?"], "answers": [["Reims", "Reims, France", "Saint Remi Basilica", "Rheims", "Rheims, France", "Durocortorum", "Saint-Remi Cathedral", "durocortorum", "rheims france", "rheims", "saint remi basilica", "reims", "reims france", "saint remi cathedral"], ["Pa\u0159\u00ed\u017e", "FRPAR", "Paris", "Name of paris and its inhabitants", "Paname", "Paris France", "Ville Lumi\u00e8re", "Leucetia", "Rue de M\u00e9nilmontant", "Paris agglomeration", "France Paris", "Sports in Paris", "Departement de Paris", "Paris, Ile-De-France", "Rue de Menilmontant", "UN/LOCODE:FRPAR", "Pa\u0159\u00ed\u017ei", "Ville Lumiere", "Paris, France", "Paris, \u00cele-de-France", "Paris, \u00cele-de-France, France", "Parijs", "Parisien", "Cuisine of Paris", "Suburbs of Paris", "Sport in Paris", "The weather in Paris", "Parisian (person)", "Parizi", "Par\u00eds", "Name of Paris and its inhabitants", "Paree", "Paris, Europe", "Paris, Banks of the Seine", "Paris (etymology)", "Paris (France)", "The City of Love (city)", "D\u00e9partement de Paris", "par\u00eds", "paris europe", "paris etymology", "paname", "cuisine of paris", "paris", "departement de paris", "pa\u0159\u00ed\u017ei", "ville lumi\u00e8re", "city of love city", "paris \u00eele de france", "paris ile de france", "pa\u0159\u00ed\u017e", "name of paris and its inhabitants", "parisian person", "sports in paris", "paris agglomeration", "d\u00e9partement de paris", "sport in paris", "ville lumiere", "paris banks of seine", "suburbs of paris", "france paris", "rue de menilmontant", "rue de m\u00e9nilmontant", "weather in paris", "paris france", "parizi", "leucetia", "paree", "paris \u00eele de france france", "frpar", "un locode frpar", "parisien", "parijs"], ["Iwerks, Ub", "Ub Iwerks", "Ub Iwerks Studio", "Celebrity Productions", "Ubbe Ert Iwwerks", "celebrity productions", "iwerks ub", "ub iwerks", "ubbe ert iwwerks", "ub iwerks studio"], ["Julia Elizabeth Wells", "Julie Elizabeth Andrews, DBE", "Julie Andrews Edwards", "Julie Wells", "Julie Elizabeth Wells", "Julie Elizabeth Andrews", "Dame Julie Andrews", "Julie Elizabeth Andrews DBE", "Julie andrews", "Julie Andrews", "julie elizabeth wells", "julie elizabeth andrews dbe", "julie elizabeth andrews", "julia elizabeth wells", "julie andrews", "julie wells", "dame julie andrews", "julie andrews edwards"], ["Barbara Morehead", "Barbara Jean Morehead", "Barbara Eden", "barbara morehead", "barbara eden", "barbara jean morehead"]], "question_ids": ["tc_2032", "tc_2063", "tc_2090", "tc_2097", "tc_2111"], "topic": "Alice in Wonderland"}}

Their city was running out of glass, a vital material for their buildings and infrastructure. The glass was made from a raw material called sand, which was becoming increasingly scarce.\n\nOne day, Emmet, the protagonist, and his friends decided to embark on a quest to find more sand. They knew that by studying the branch of science with four fundamental principles - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, also known as arithmetic - they could calculate the exact location of a hidden sand deposit.\n\nAs they journeyed through the land, they encountered a wise, old ostrich named Speedy, who was known to be the fastest animal on two legs. Speedy offered to help Emmet and his friends in their quest, using his incredible speed to scout the area for sand deposits.\n\nDuring their search, they stumbled upon a mysterious forest filled with mosses, which are classified as belonging to the Bryophyta division of the plant kingdom. The mosses seemed to be thriving in this unique environment, and Emmet and his friends wondered if there was a connection between the mosses and the sand they were seeking.\n\nAfter studying the mosses and using their arithmetic skills, they discovered that the mosses were actually breaking down rocks into sand through a slow, natural process. With the help of Speedy, they were able to gather enough sand to bring back to Bricksburg, saving the city from its glass shortage.\n\nThe citizens of Bricksburg rejoiced, and Emmet and his friends were hailed as heroes. They had not only found a new source of sand but also learned valuable lessons about the interconnectedness of the natural world and the importance of working together. And so, life in the Lego Movie universe continued to thrive, thanks to the power of friendship, knowledge, and a little help from an ostrich named Speedy."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 4, "question_count": 5}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What raw material is used for making glass?", "What name is given to the change of state from liquid to gas?", "Which branch of science has four fundamental principles: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.", "What is the fastest animal on two legs?", "Mosses are classified as belonging to which part of the plant kingdom?"], "answers": [["Sandiest", "Coversand", "Desert sand", "Psammophilous", "Psammophile", "Sand", "Floor sugar", "Sand-grain", "Floor-sugar", "Sand grain", "Grains of sand", "sand grain", "floor sugar", "desert sand", "sandiest", "sand", "coversand", "psammophilous", "grains of sand", "psammophile"], ["Evaporating", "Vapourization", "Evapouration", "Verdunstung", "Vaporized", "\u00c9vaporation", "Evaporates", "Evapourate", "Evaporation", "Vaporizing", "Vaporise", "Evaporate", "Vapourise", "Evaporated", "Vaporizes", "evaporates", "vaporized", "evaporate", "evaporation", "vaporizing", "evaporating", "evaporated", "evapouration", "evapourate", "vaporizes", "vapourization", "verdunstung", "\u00e9vaporation", "vaporise", "vapourise"], ["+-*/", "Arithmetic operations", "Arithmetics", "Multiplicative operator", "Arithmetik", "Aritmetika", "Arithmetic operation", "History of arithmetic", "Arithmatic", "Arithmetic operators", "Rithmetic", "Arithmetician", "+-x/", "+\u2212\u00d7\u00f7", "Arithmetic operator", "Arithmetical operations", "Arithmetic", "Additive operator", "arithmetic operations", "arithmetics", "arithmetic operators", "history of arithmetic", "arithmetic", "additive operator", "arithmatic", "\u2212\u00d7\u00f7", "x", "arithmetic operation", "multiplicative operator", "rithmetic", "arithmetician", "arithmetic operator", "arithmetik", "aritmetika", "arithmetical operations"], ["Ostrich farms", "An Ostrich", "Ostrich Egg", "Ostriches", "Struthio camelus", "Ostrage", "Common Ostrich", "Ostrich farming", "Masai Ostrich", "Ostritch", "Common ostrich", "Osterich", "Ostrish", "Struthious", "Osterish", "Ostrich", "Ostrich farm", "Ostridge", "Ostrich Racing", "Ostrich race", "Ostrich meat", "Ostrich farmer", "ostriches", "ostrish", "ostrich racing", "ostrich race", "ostritch", "ostrich egg", "ostrich", "osterish", "ostridge", "struthio camelus", "ostrich farming", "ostrich farmer", "ostrage", "ostrich farms", "struthious", "masai ostrich", "ostrich meat", "ostrich farm", "common ostrich", "osterich"], ["Bryophyta (disambiguation)", "Bryophyta", "bryophyta disambiguation", "bryophyta"]], "question_ids": ["tc_2728", "tc_2744", "tc_2758", "tc_2805", "tc_2838"], "topic": "Lego Movie"}}

They chose the mathematical constant Pi, which they inscribed on the base of the monument with a value of 3.141 to three decimal places. This symbol served as a reminder of their everlasting bond and the limitless possibilities of their united world.\n\nAnd so, the Angry Birds and pigs lived in peace and harmony, their world enriched by the wonders of gypsum, the beauty of The Pup's Beacon, the magic of helium, and the wisdom of Pi. Their monument stood as a testament to their unity, and the three primary colours of light shone brightly, symbolizing the enduring power of friendship and the triumph of love over conflict."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 2, "question_count": 5}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which common mineral is used to make casts, moulds, blackboard chalk and plaster of Paris?", "Which star is as bright as 23 Suns, and is orbited by the Pup?", "What are the three primary colours of light?", "What is the second lightest chemical element?", "Used in mathematics, what is the value of Pi to three decimal places?"], "answers": [["CaSO4\u00b72H2O", "Gypsum", "Calcium sulfate dihydrate", "CaSO4*2H2O", "Gipsum", "calcium sulfate dihydrate", "caso4 2h2o", "gipsum", "caso4\u00b72h2o", "gypsum"], ["Gliese 244 A", "Gliese 244 B", "\u03a3\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2", "Alhabor", "Aschere", "Sirius B", "Sirius A", "Sirius", "Swart star", "WD 0642\u2013166", "HIP 32349", "Gliese 244", "Alpha Canis Majoris", "\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0631\u0649", "HD 48915", "The Dog-Star", "Sirius.B", "Alpha CMa", "Alpha Canis Maioris", "'A", "\u0391 Canis Majoris A", "\u0391 Canis Majoris", "\u0391 CMa", "Canicula", "SAO 151881", "Sirius (star)", "Dog stars", "WD 0642-166", "Sirius-B", "sirius star", "gliese 244", "\u03b1 canis majoris", "\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2", "alpha canis maioris", "sao 151881", "alpha cma", "dog star", "wd 0642\u2013166", "alhabor", "sirius b", "aschere", "\u03b1 cma", "alpha canis majoris", "hd 48915", "wd 0642 166", "canicula", "gliese 244 b", "swart star", "sirius", "dog stars", "hip 32349", "\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0631\u0649"], ["Red, Blue and Green", "red blue and green"], ["Solid Helium", "Superfluid helium", "Two fluid model for helium", "Helium II", "Balloon grade helium", "Helium gas", "He (element)", "Inhaling Helium", "E939", "Element 2", "Atomic number 2", "ATCvet code QV03AN03", "ATC code V03AN03", "Helium", "Helium shortage", "solid helium", "helium ii", "helium shortage", "atcvet code qv03an03", "two fluid model for helium", "helium", "helium gas", "superfluid helium", "element 2", "atomic number 2", "he element", "balloon grade helium", "inhaling helium", "e939", "atc code v03an03"], ["three point one four two  degrees", "3.142 degrees", "3.142", "3 142 degrees", "three point one four two degrees", "3 142"]], "question_ids": ["tc_3070", "tc_3156", "qz_2", "qz_68", "qz_74"], "topic": "Angry Birds Movie"}}

They had been brought together by a film called \"Space Cowboys,\" which documented their adventures in space.\n\nAs they ventured through the land, they stumbled upon a deck of ancient playing cards. Intrigued, they discovered that only three of the Kings in the deck had a moustache. The astronauts pondered the significance of this, but their thoughts were interrupted by the sudden appearance of a small, peculiar creature.\n\nThe creature introduced itself as a Gremlin and warned the astronauts about three important rules they must follow while in the Land Before Time: never feed a Gremlin after midnight, never get a Gremlin wet, and never expose a Gremlin to bright light. The astronauts, grateful for the advice, continued their journey with caution.\n\nSoon, they arrived at a beautiful archipelago known as the Canary Islands. To their surprise, the islands were not named after canaries, but rather after the large, majestic dogs that roamed the land. The astronauts marveled at the sight of these magnificent animals, which were unlike any they had seen before.\n\nAs they explored the islands, they encountered a woman named Angela, who had a captivating aura about her. She shared her story with the astronauts, revealing that she was the inspiration behind the Rolling Stones song \"Angie.\" Her last name, however, remained a mystery, as she preferred to keep it a secret.\n\nThe astronauts, having learned much from their journey through the Land Before Time, eventually returned to their own time, forever changed by the incredible experiences they had shared. They would always remember the lessons they had learned, the friends they had made, and the enchanting world they had discovered.\n---\nFeedback: The response is creative and engaging, incorporating all five questions into the story. The information provided is accurate, including the film \"Space Cowboys,\" the number of Kings with a moustache in a standard deck of cards, the rules for taking care of a Gremlin, the origin of the Canary Islands' name, and the reference to the Rolling Stones song \"Angie.\"\n\nThe story is coherent and flows well, with each element of the questions being woven into the narrative seamlessly. The characters and settings are interesting and well-developed, making the story enjoyable to read.\n\nOne area for improvement could be to provide more context or background for the astronauts' journey to the Land Before Time. Additionally, the story could benefit from a more conclusive ending, perhaps by having the astronauts apply the lessons they learned in their own lives or by revealing the secret of Angela's last name.\n\nOverall, the response is well-written and effectively incorporates the answers to the five questions into a cohesive and entertaining story.\n---\nBased on your initial response and the subsequent feedback, revise the response.

The annual Rainbow Brite Festival was just around the corner, and everyone was preparing for the grand event. This year, the festival was dedicated to celebrating the achievements of some of the most remarkable individuals from different realms.\n\nRainbow Brite, the guardian of colors, was in charge of organizing the festival. She wanted to ensure that the event was both entertaining and educational. To achieve this, she decided to create a Hall of Fame, showcasing the accomplishments of five extraordinary individuals.\n\nThe first exhibit in the Hall of Fame was dedicated to Donald Bradman, a legendary cricketer from the realm of sports. Rainbow Brite created a beautiful display that highlighted his incredible career, including his last ever test match innings, where he scored a surprising 0 runs. Despite this, his overall achievements were nothing short of remarkable.\n\nNext, Rainbow Brite honored Eddy Merckx, a cyclist from the realm of endurance. Nicknamed \"The Cannibal,\" he was the only rider to have won all three jerseys in the same year in the Tour de France. His exhibit showcased his fierce determination and unparalleled skill in the world of cycling.\n\nThe third exhibit paid tribute to Captain America, a superhero from the realm of comics. His arch-nemesis, the Red Skull, was a constant threat to the world. Rainbow Brite's display showcased Captain America's bravery and unwavering commitment to justice.\n\nIn the fourth exhibit, Rainbow Brite honored Ironside, a detective who first appeared on TV in 1967. Despite solving all of his crimes sitting down due to a disability, Ironside's intelligence and keen eye for detail made him a formidable crime solver. His exhibit was a testament to the power of the human mind.\n\nFinally, the last exhibit celebrated Wyatt Earp, a legendary lawman from the realm of the Wild West. Rainbow Brite's display highlighted his courage and resilience, as he was shot multiple times throughout his life but always managed to survive and continue his pursuit of justice.\n\nAs the Rainbow Brite Festival commenced, the Hall of Fame became a popular attraction, inspiring visitors with the incredible stories of these five remarkable individuals. The festival itself was a dazzling spectacle, with colorful parades, exciting games, and delicious treats that reflected the diverse realms represented in the Hall of Fame.\n\nThe impact of the Hall of Fame on the visitors was profound, as they learned about the power of determination, courage, and resilience in the face of adversity. The festival was a resounding success, and Rainbow Brite's dedication to celebrating the achievements of others brought even more color and joy to her magical world. The visitors left the festival with a renewed sense of inspiration, ready to face their own challenges and make their mark on the world."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 3, "question_count": 5}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["How many runs did Donald Bradman score in his last ever test match innings?", "Nicknamed the cannibal, who is the only rider to have won all three jerseys in the same year in the Tour de France?", "Whose arch nemisis is the Red Skull?", "First appearing on TV in 1967, which detective solved all of his crimes sitting down?", "How many times was Wyatt Earp shot?"], "answers": [["None", "None (disambiguation)", "none", "none disambiguation"], ["Edward Merckx", "Eddy merkx", "Eddie Merckx", "Edouard Louis Joseph, Baron Merckx", "Eddy Merckx", "Eddy Merx", "Eddie Merx", "Eddy Merkx", "Eddy Merckx (cyclist)", "Eddie Merkx", "Eddy merx", "eddie merkx", "edouard louis joseph baron merckx", "eddie merx", "eddy merckx", "eddie merckx", "eddy merx", "eddy merkx", "edward merckx", "eddy merckx cyclist"], ["Runaways (comics)", "The Runaways (comics)", "Captain Americas", "Fantastic Fourteen", "Runaways (comics) (story arcs)", "Runaways (comic)", "Runaways (film)", "Captain America's", "captain americas", "runaways comics story arcs", "captain america s", "runaways comics", "fantastic fourteen", "runaways film", "runaways comic"], ["Ironside (disambiguation)", "Ironside", "Ironsides", "ironside disambiguation", "ironside", "ironsides"], ["None", "None (disambiguation)", "none", "none disambiguation"]], "question_ids": ["qz_2537", "qz_2538", "qz_2562", "qz_2567", "qz_2589"], "topic": "Rainbow Brite"}}

The turtles knew that Hudson was last seen at a glamorous party attended by various celebrities, including the enigmatic La Toya Jackson, who had appeared in Celebrity Big Brother in January 2009.\n\nAs the turtles investigated the case, they discovered a cryptic clue that led them to an old, dimly lit movie theater. The theater was playing the 1955 comedy movie We're No Angels, which centered on three escaped convicts. Two of the convicts were played by the talented Peter Ustinov and Aldo Ray, but the third was played by none other than the legendary Humphrey Bogart. The turtles believed that the answer to Hudson's disappearance might be hidden within the film's witty dialogue and slapstick humor.\n\nWhile watching the movie, the turtles noticed a character who bore a striking resemblance to King Arthur from the 1967 musical film Camelot, played by the charismatic Richard Harris. This character mentioned a secret location where the butler Hudson might be held captive. The turtles quickly realized that they needed to find this place and rescue Hudson before it was too late.\n\nAs the turtles raced against time, they stumbled upon a chilling news article about the 2009 conviction of Phil Spector for the murder of Lana Clarkson. This piece of information seemed unrelated to their mission, but they couldn't shake the feeling that it was somehow connected.\n\nFinally, the turtles found the secret location, hidden deep within the city's labyrinthine sewer system. They rescued Hudson from the clutches of an evil villain who had been obsessed with the lives of celebrities and famous crimes. The villain, a twisted mastermind, had kidnapped Hudson to reenact the Phil Spector case, but the turtles arrived just in time to save him.\n\nWith Hudson safe and sound, the turtles returned him to his grateful employer. The city of New York could once again rest easy, knowing that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were always ready to solve any mystery and protect its citizens. As the turtles disappeared into the shadows, they left behind a legacy of courage, teamwork, and an unwavering commitment to justice."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 5}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What was the surname of the butler played by Gordon Jackson in Upstairs Downstairs?", "Which Jackson appeared in Celebrity Big Brother in January 2009?", "The 1955 comedy movie We're No Angels centred on three escaped convicts.

Through their journey, the trolls not only gained a greater understanding of human history and culture but also learned valuable lessons about leadership, curiosity, and innovation.

They learned about a river that flowed underground, rising in Hampstead and passing through St. Pancras, down Farringdon Street, and finally entering the Thames by Blackfriars Bridge. The Minions were fascinated by the mysterious Fleet River and its secret journey through the city.\n\nLastly, the Minions discovered a captivating story about a dancer who had only one notable film cameo.

The Minions were impressed by the dancer's agility and skill, and they couldn't help but admire the thrilling scene.\n\nIn the end, the Minions had successfully found the answers to all five questions.

Wimbledon, the oldest and most prestigious tennis tournament in the world, was a testament to Arthur's incredible talent. Despite his success in tennis, Arthur had a secret passion for dragons and dreamt of training one.\n\nOne day, while exploring the nearby mountains, Arthur stumbled upon a dragon's nest. To his surprise, he found a rare South African fast dragon, known as the White Lightning. Arthur knew this was his chance to fulfill his dream of training a dragon.\n\nArthur began to visit the dragon daily, slowly gaining its trust. He named the dragon Edmund, after the famous mountaineer Edmund Hillary, who, along with Tenzing Norgay, became the first to reach the summit of Mount Everest in 1953. Arthur admired their determination and teamwork, and he hoped to achieve the same with his dragon.\n\nAs Arthur and Edmund's bond grew stronger, they began to perform incredible feats together. They soared through the skies, raced against the wind, and even played tennis with Arthur's powerful serves and Edmund's fiery returns.\n\nOne day, Arthur received an invitation to participate in a unique competition. It was a charity event organized by Goldie Hawn, a high school football coach who had recently starred in a 1986 film called \"Wildcats.\" The competition involved a race around the world, and the participants were to use various modes of transportation.\n\nArthur knew this was the perfect opportunity to showcase his bond with Edmund. They decided to enter the race, and their journey began. Along the way, they encountered many challenges, but their teamwork and determination helped them overcome each obstacle.\n\nDuring the final leg of the race, Arthur and Edmund found themselves sailing across the ocean on a ship named the Nina, captained by an Italian explorer named Christopher Columbus. Columbus, who had once sailed with the famous ships Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria on his voyage to the New World, was impressed by Arthur and Edmund's bond and offered them guidance on their journey.\n\nWith Columbus's help, Arthur and Edmund crossed the finish line, winning the race and proving that with determination, trust, and teamwork, anything is possible. The villagers celebrated their victory, and Arthur and Edmund became legends, inspiring others to believe in the power of friendship and the magic of dragons. The story of Arthur and Edmund served as a reminder that even the most unlikely of dreams can come true with perseverance and a strong bond between friends."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 3, "question_count": 5}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Who in 1975 became the first black man to win a Wimbledon singles title?", "Which South African fast bowler had the nickname White Lightning", "In 1953, Edmund Hillary was half of the famous pair to first do what?", "1986 film starring Goldie Hawn as a High School football coach.", "Which Italian explorer had ships named Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria?"], "answers": [["Arthur Ashe, Jr.", "Arthur Robert Ashe, Jr.", "Ashe, Arthur Robert", "Arthur ash", "Arthur R.

The school was known for its lively and mischievous students, who were always up to some adventure or the other.\n\nOne day, while strolling through the school's garden, Princess St. Trinian came across a talking frog. The frog, named Mr. Chips, had a peculiar charm about him. He was played by the talented actor who starred in the 2002 TV adaptation of \"Goodbye Mr. Chips.\" Intrigued by the frog's eloquence, the princess couldn't help but engage in a conversation with him.\n\nAs they spoke, Mr. Chips asked the princess a thought-provoking question, \"Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?\" The princess pondered over the question and realized that, indeed, the focus had always been on the mischief and adventures of her students, rather than their education.\n\nDetermined to change this, Princess St. Trinian sought Mr. Chips' help in transforming the school into a place of learning and growth. Mr. Chips agreed, but on one condition - the princess had to give him a kiss. Reluctantly, she agreed, and upon kissing the frog, he transformed into a wise and experienced teacher.\n\nTogether, they worked tirelessly to improve the school's curriculum and teaching methods. The students, initially resistant to the changes, soon realized the importance of education and embraced the new approach. The school's reputation soared, and it became a beacon of knowledge and wisdom.\n\nOne day, as the princess and Mr. Chips were discussing the school's progress, he asked her, \"Are you going to come quietly, or do I have to use earplugs?\" Confused, the princess inquired about the meaning behind his question. Mr. Chips explained that he wanted to know if she would continue to support the school's transformation without any hesitation or if he would have to convince her further.\n\nWith a smile, Princess St. Trinian assured Mr. Chips that she was fully committed to their mission. Together, they continued to nurture the students of the school, ensuring that they received the best education possible. And so, the story of the Princess and the Frog became a tale of growth, learning, and the power of collaboration.\n---\nFeedback: The response is creative and well-written, incorporating all the given information into a coherent story.

Otto was a retired captain who had spent his entire life sailing the seas and exploring the world. He was known for his vast knowledge and incredible stories.\n\nOne day, a young boy named Milo approached Otto with a burning curiosity. He had heard about the legendary shipping forecast area directly north of German Bight and wanted to learn more. Otto, with a twinkle in his eye, began to tell Milo a tale about his adventures in the mysterious Dogger Bank.\n\nDuring one of his voyages, Otto's ship encountered a massive storm. The winds were so strong that they blew the ship off course, and Otto found himself lost at sea. Desperate to find his way back, he remembered an ancient map he had seen with the number 1009 written in Roman Numerals - M IX. Otto believed that this number held the key to his salvation, as it represented a crucial navigational coordinate.\n\nAs the storm raged on, Otto and his crew sought refuge in a hidden cove. There, they discovered a cave filled with treasures and relics from the past. Among the artifacts, they found a collection of records from a band called The Moody Blues, who had hits with \"Go Now\" and \"Nights in White Satin.\" The music brought comfort to the weary sailors and lifted their spirits.\n\nAs the storm subsided, Otto stumbled upon a portrait of a statesman known as the Iron Chancellor. He recognized the man as Otto von Bismarck, a brilliant leader who had unified Germany. Inspired by Bismarck's determination and strength, Otto decided to use his newfound knowledge to navigate his way back home, drawing parallels between Bismarck's unification efforts and his own journey to reunite with his loved ones.\n\nWith the help of the stars, the ancient map, and the coordinates represented by M IX, Otto and his crew set sail once more. Along the way, they encountered a dove, the same type of bird that was first released by Noah in the biblical story. The dove guided them through the treacherous waters, leading them safely back to Fortuna.\n\nUpon their return, the townspeople celebrated Otto and his crew's miraculous journey. The tale of their adventure in Dogger Bank, guided by the wisdom of the Iron Chancellor, the music of The Moody Blues, and the mysterious coordinates M IX, became a legend passed down through generations. And as for young Milo, he was forever inspired by Otto's bravery and the wonders of the world that awaited him beyond the horizon."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 2, "question_count": 5}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which shipping forecast area is directly north of German Bight?", "What is 1009 when expressed as Roman Numerals?", "Who had hits with Go Now and Nights in White Satin?", "Which statesman was known as the Iron Chancellor?", "What type of bird was the first released by Noah?"], "answers": [["Fisher", "Fishers", "Fisher (disambiguation)", "fishers", "fisher disambiguation", "fisher"], ["MIX", "MIXAL", "MIXAL programming language", "MIX (computer programming)", "mixal", "mix", "mixal programming language", "mix computer programming"], ["Moody Blues", "The Moody Blues", "Moodies", "MoodyBlues", "22 thousand days", "Twenty-two thousand days", "Moodyblues", "22,000 days", "Moody Blues,The", "Moody Blues, The", "22000 days", "twenty two thousand days", "22000 days", "moody blues", "moodyblues", "22 thousand days", "22 000 days", "moodies"], ["Count von Bismarck-Schoenausen", "Iron Chancellor (disambiguation)", "Otto van Bismark", "Otto Von Bismarck", "Prince Otto Eduard Leopold von Bismarck", "Otto von Bismark", "Otto von bismarck", "Accident Insurance Bill of 1884", "Otto vanBismark", "Otto Eduard Leopold, Furst von Bismarck", "Otto von Blotto", "Bismarckian", "Otto F\u00fcrst von Bismarck", "Otto Van Bismark", "Otto van Bismarck", "Otto Eduard Leopold Bismarck", "Otto Von Bismark", "Otto Fuerst von Bismarck", "Otto Eduard Leopold von Bismarck", "Economy of Germany under Bismarck", "Otto Eduard Leopold von Bismarck, Count of Bismarck-Sch\u00f6nhausen, Duke of Lauenburg, Prince of Bismarck", "Otto Eduard Leopold, Fuerst von Bismarck", "Count Otto von Bismarck", "Health Insurance Bill of 1883", "Iron Chancellor", "Otto Furst von Bismarck", "Otto Bismarck", "Prince Bismarck", "Kaizer Bismark", "Otto Eduard Leopold Von, Prince Bismarck", "Kaiser Bismark", "Otto of Bismarck", "Old Age and Disability Insurance Bill of 1889", "Otto Eduard Leopold von Bismarck, Prince Bismarck", "Von Bismarck", "Prince Otto Edward Leopold von Bismarck", "Otto Eduard Leopold, F\u00fcrst von Bismarck", "The Iron Chancellor", "Otto von Bismarck", "Otto Van Bismarck", "Von bismark", "otto of bismarck", "otto vanbismark", "otto eduard leopold von bismarck count of bismarck sch\u00f6nhausen duke of lauenburg prince of bismarck", "otto van bismark", "von bismark", "count von bismarck schoenausen", "bismarckian", "von bismarck", "accident insurance bill of 1884", "kaizer bismark", "otto f\u00fcrst von bismarck", "otto furst von bismarck", "otto eduard leopold fuerst von bismarck", "otto eduard leopold von prince bismarck", "otto eduard leopold bismarck", "otto eduard leopold furst von bismarck", "otto eduard leopold f\u00fcrst von bismarck", "kaiser bismark", "health insurance bill of 1883", "iron chancellor", "otto bismarck", "otto van bismarck", "economy of germany under bismarck", "prince otto edward leopold von bismarck", "otto eduard leopold von bismarck prince bismarck", "otto eduard leopold von bismarck", "prince bismarck", "count otto von bismarck", "iron chancellor disambiguation", "old age and disability insurance bill of 1889", "otto von bismark", "prince otto eduard leopold von bismarck", "otto von blotto", "otto von bismarck", "otto fuerst von bismarck"], ["Corbies", "Ravin", "Raven (bird)", "Raven", "ravin", "raven bird", "raven", "corbies"]], "question_ids": ["qz_5420", "qz_5487", "qz_5489", "qz_5493", "qz_5511"], "topic": "Up"}}

As he journeyed through the land, he encountered a mysterious figure who claimed to be the spirit of Queen Elizabeth I, the British monarch who famously said, \"I don't wish to open windows into men's souls.\" The spirit, appearing as a regal apparition with a golden aura, offered to guide Link on his quest, but only if he could answer a series of riddles.\n\nThe first riddle was about a British singer who played Jareth the Goblin King in the 1986 film 'Labyrinth.' Link, being a fan of classic movies, quickly answered, \"David Bowie!\" The spirit nodded in approval and continued with the second riddle, her voice echoing through the ancient forest that surrounded them.\n\nThe next riddle was about the 1987 film 'Cry Freedom,' which was a biographical drama about a South African civil rights leader. Link thought for a moment, recalling the inspiring story he had once heard, and then replied, \"Steve Biko!\" The spirit smiled and moved on to the third riddle.\n\nThe third riddle asked which British actress played Valerie in the 1997 film 'Nil By Mouth.' Link, who had seen the movie with Princess Zelda during a quiet evening in the castle, confidently answered, \"Kathy Burke!\" The spirit was impressed and presented the fourth riddle, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.\n\nThe fourth riddle was about a Brazilian player who won the Women's Singles Finals at Wimbledon in 1959, 1960, and 1964. Link, a tennis enthusiast, immediately responded, \"Maria Bueno!\" The spirit, now thoroughly impressed, granted Link the power to see into the hearts of his enemies, a gift that would prove invaluable in his quest to save Princess Zelda.\n\nWith the spirit's guidance and his newfound power, Link traversed treacherous landscapes, battled fearsome creatures, and solved intricate puzzles. He was able to defeat Ganondorf in a climactic battle atop a crumbling tower, using his ability to see into the hearts of his enemies to exploit the dark lord's weaknesses.\n\nUpon rescuing Princess Zelda, the kingdom of Hyrule celebrated their victory with a grand festival, filled with music, laughter, and joy. The spirit of Queen Elizabeth I returned to the realm of history, satisfied that she had helped a worthy hero. And so, the legend of Zelda continued, with Link and Zelda's names forever etched in the annals of time, their adventures inspiring generations to come."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 5}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which British monarch famously said \u2018I don\u2019t wish to open windows into men\u2019s souls\u2019?", "Which British singer played Jareth the Goblin King in the 1986 film \u2018Labyrinth\u2019?", "The 1987 film \u2018Cry Freedom\u2019 is a biographical drama about which South African civil rights leader?", "Which British actress played Valerie in the 1997 film \u2018Nil By Mouth\u2019?", "What was the name of the Brazilian player who won the Women\u2019s Singles Finals at Wimbledon in 1959, 1960 and 1964?"], "answers": [["The Gloriana", "Queen Elisabeth of england", "Elizabeth the First", "Queene Elisabeth of England", "Bess of England", "Elizabeth I of Ireland", "Queen Elizabeth 1", "Queen Elisabeth I", "Elizabeth I (England)", "Elizabeth I of Great Britain", "Queen of England Elizabeth", "Queen Elizabeth the first", "Queen Elizabeth I of England", "Elizabeth the first", "Elizabeth I of the United Kingdom", "Queen of England Elizabeth I", "QEI", "Elizabeth I", "Queen Elizabeth of England", "Elisabeth 1st", "La Vita della Regina Elizabetta", "Elisabeth I of England", "Elisabeth of England", "Queen Elizabeth the First", "Elizabeth I of England", "Good Queen Bess", "Liz 1", "Virgin Queen", "Elizabeth 1", "Queen Elizabeth l", "Elizabeth of England", "Elizabeth I Tudor", "Elizabeth Tudor", "Elizabeth I, Queen of England", "Elizabeth the 1st", "Queen Elizabeth I", "Elizabeth i of england", "Elisabeth I", "elizabeth first", "elizabeth i of ireland", "elizabeth tudor", "queen elizabeth 1", "elizabeth i", "queen of england elizabeth i", "queen elizabeth i of england", "la vita della regina elizabetta", "good queen bess", "queen elisabeth of england", "elisabeth i", "elisabeth i of england", "elizabeth i england", "elizabeth i of england", "bess of england", "elizabeth of england", "queen elizabeth l", "elisabeth 1st", "elizabeth 1st", "qei", "queen elizabeth of england", "elizabeth 1", "elizabeth i of great britain", "queen of england elizabeth", "queene elisabeth of england", "queen elizabeth i", "elisabeth of england", "gloriana", "elizabeth i of united kingdom", "queen elisabeth i", "queen elizabeth first", "elizabeth i tudor", "virgin queen", "elizabeth i queen of england", "liz 1"], ["Hermione Farthingale", "Ziggy Stardust (persona)", "The Berlin Trilogy", "Berlin Trilogy", "Bowiesque", "David Bowie", "David bowie filmography", "Davie Jones and the King Bees", "Bowiean", "David bowie", "Tao Jones Index", "Bowie, David", "The Konrads", "Davie Jones with the King Bees", "David Bowie's", "David Bowi", "Davis bowie", "The Manish Boys", "David Robert Hayward-Jones", "Ziggy stardust (persona)", "The King of Glitter Rock", "David Hayward-Jones", "The Lower Third", "Davy Jones and the Lower Third", "tao jones index", "bowie david", "konrads", "davis bowie", "king of glitter rock", "david robert hayward jones", "berlin trilogy", "david bowi", "davy jones and lower third", "david bowie filmography", "davie jones and king bees", "ziggy stardust persona", "bowiesque", "manish boys", "david hayward jones", "hermione farthingale", "david bowie s", "david bowie", "bowiean", "davie jones with king bees", "lower third"], ["Steve Biko", "Steve Bantu Biko", "Bantu Steven Biko", "Steven Biko", "Stephen Bantu Biko", "Stephen Biko", "Gerhardus Hattingh", "steven biko", "gerhardus hattingh", "steve bantu biko", "stephen bantu biko", "stephen biko", "bantu steven biko", "steve biko"], ["Kathy Burke", "Katherine Lucy Bridget Burke", "Cathy Burke", "cathy burke", "kathy burke", "katherine lucy bridget burke"], ["Maria Ester Bueno", "Maria Esther Bueno", "Maria Ester Audion Bueno", "Maria Esther Andion Bueno", "Maria Bueno", "Bueno, Maria Esther Andion", "maria bueno", "maria esther bueno", "maria ester audion bueno", "maria ester bueno", "bueno maria esther andion", "maria esther andion bueno"]], "question_ids": ["qb_345", "qb_355", "qb_370", "qb_382", "qb_388"], "topic": "Legend of Zelda"}}
