Pikachu was fascinated by the idea of cowboys and stagecoaches, and he couldn't help but imagine himself as a cowboy Pikachu, riding into the sunset.\n\nAs Pikachu continued to explore the library, he came across a section dedicated to music. He found a book about a famous rock group called Pink Floyd, which featured Dave Gilmore and Roger Waters. Pikachu was captivated by their music and decided to listen to some of their songs.

As the music played, Pikachu felt a sense of adventure and wanderlust, and he imagined himself traveling down the highway with his friends, exploring new places and meeting new people.\n\nAs Pikachu's curiosity grew, he found a book about the history of the Olympics. He learned that in 1984, the LA Olympics took place, and there was only one eastern bloc country that participated: Romania. Pikachu was inspired by the courage and determination of the Romanian athletes who defied the odds and competed in the games.\n\nFinally, Pikachu stumbled upon a section about comic strips and television shows. He discovered a 90s sci-fi series called \"The Wild Palms,\" starring James Belushi. The show was based on Bruce Wagner's comic strip of the same name. Pikachu was captivated by the futuristic world portrayed in the series and the comic strip, and he couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to live in such a world.\n\nAs Pikachu left the library, he felt a newfound appreciation for the world outside of Pok\u00e9mon battles.

Superman congratulated the golfer and continued on his way, feeling inspired by the dedication and hard work of the athletes he had encountered.\n\nAs the day came to an end, Superman found himself in Thailand, marveling at the impressive Sky Train Rail Bridge. The engineering marvel connected different parts of the country, making transportation more efficient and convenient for its citizens. As he admired the bridge, Superman reflected on the incredible achievements of humanity and felt proud to be a part of a world filled with such talent and determination.\n\nWith a renewed sense of purpose, Superman returned to Metropolis, ready to continue his mission to protect and serve the people of Earth.

The competition was organized to celebrate the six Olympic gold medals won by Gert Fredriksson, a legendary kayaker from a distant land. People from all corners of Middle-earth gathered to witness this grand event.\n\nAmong the participants was Mike Hawthorn, a former Formula One motor racing world champion from another realm. He was known for his incredible skill, having won 14 of his 45 races. The people of Middle-earth were excited to see him compete against their finest warriors and athletes.\n\nAs the competition approached, the people of Gondor were plagued by a mysterious phenomenon known as \"Spam.\" This was a form of unwanted messages that spread across the Internet, a magical communication network used by the people of Middle-earth. The Spam caused great annoyance and disrupted the preparations for the competition.\n\nIn their search for a solution, the people of Gondor sought the help of the wise scholars from the Juilliard School, a prestigious institution founded in New York in 1905. These scholars were known for their expertise in music, dance, and drama, and they were confident that they could find a way to stop the Spam and save the competition.\n\nAs the scholars worked tirelessly to solve the problem, they stumbled upon a book called \"My Life and Loves,\" written in 1926 by Frank Harris.

The competition was organized to celebrate the six Olympic gold medals won by Gert Fredriksson, a legendary kayaker from a distant land. People from all corners of Middle-earth gathered to witness this grand event.\n\nAmong the participants was Mike Hawthorn, a former Formula One motor racing world champion from another realm. He was known for his incredible skill, having won 14 of his 45 races. The people of Middle-earth were excited to see him compete against their finest warriors and athletes.\n\nAs the competition approached, the people of Gondor were plagued by a mysterious phenomenon known as \"Spam.\" This was a form of unwanted messages that spread across the Internet, a magical communication network used by the people of Middle-earth. The Spam caused great annoyance and disrupted the preparations for the competition.\n\nIn their search for a solution, the people of Gondor sought the help of the wise scholars from the Juilliard School, a prestigious institution founded in New York in 1905. These scholars were known for their expertise in music, dance, and drama, and they were confident that they could find a way to stop the Spam and save the competition.\n\nAs the scholars worked tirelessly to solve the problem, they stumbled upon a book called \"My Life and Loves,\" written in 1926 by Frank Harris. This book, originally banned in the US, contained the secret to defeating the Spam. The scholars used the knowledge from the book to create a powerful spell that banished the Spam from Middle-earth.\n\nWith the Spam gone, the competition commenced, and the people of Gondor celebrated the incredible feats of Gert Fredriksson and Mike Hawthorn.

One day, while discussing his fear with his wife, Jane, she mentioned that the letter 't' is the second most common letter used in the English language. This fact made George even more anxious, as he couldn't help but notice the letter 't' everywhere he looked.\n\nDetermined to help her husband, Jane decided to research a solution. She came across the story of Alfred Nobel, who became famous in 1867 for inventing dynamite. Inspired by Nobel's ingenuity, Jane thought that perhaps a groundbreaking invention could help George overcome his taphephobia.\n\nAs she continued her research, Jane discovered an interesting fact: the letter 'q' is the only letter of the alphabet that does not appear in any of the names of the 50 American states. This fact sparked an idea in her mind. She decided to create a toothpaste called \"Q-Enamel,\" which would strengthen teeth and help people overcome their fear of losing them.\n\nJane worked tirelessly on her invention, and when it was finally complete, she presented it to George. He was hesitant at first, but after using Q-Enamel for a few weeks, he noticed a significant improvement in the strength of his teeth. His taphephobia began to fade, and he was able to enjoy his life once again.\n\nTo celebrate George's triumph over his fear, the Jetsons decided to throw a party. They invited all their friends and family, and the event was a huge success.

He had developed taphephobia, the fear of losing his teeth. This fear had started to affect his daily life, making it difficult for him to enjoy his favorite meals. One day, while discussing his fear with his wife, Jane, she mentioned that the letter 't' is the second most common letter used in the English language. This fact made George even more anxious, as he couldn't help but notice the letter 't' everywhere he looked.\n\nDetermined to help her husband, Jane decided to research a solution. She came across the story of Alfred Nobel, who became famous in 1867 for inventing dynamite. Inspired by Nobel's ingenuity, Jane thought that perhaps a groundbreaking invention could help George overcome his taphephobia.\n\nAs she continued her research, Jane discovered an interesting fact: the letter 'q' is the only letter of the alphabet that does not appear in any of the names of the 50 American states. This fact sparked an idea in her mind. She decided to create a toothpaste called \"Q-Enamel,\" which would strengthen teeth and help people overcome their fear of losing them.\n\nJane worked tirelessly on her invention, and when it was finally complete, she presented it to George. He was hesitant at first, but after using Q-Enamel for a few weeks, he noticed a significant improvement in the strength of his teeth. His taphephobia began to fade, and he was able to enjoy his life once again.\n\nTo celebrate George's triumph over his fear, the Jetsons decided to throw a party. They invited all their friends and family, and the event was a huge success. As the night went on, they played music from various eras, including the Spice Girls' debut single, \"Wannabe.\" Everyone danced and sang along, grateful for the invention that had brought joy back into George's life.

The children joined Robin Hood and his band of merry animals on their adventures, learning about friendship, bravery, and standing up for what's right.\n\nNext, the Magic School Bus transported the children to the recording studio where Neil Morrissey provided the voice for Bob the Builder on his number one hit, \"Can We Fix It?\" The children sang along with Bob and his team of talking construction vehicles, feeling inspired by their can-do attitude and teamwork.\n\nSuddenly, the Magic School Bus whisked the children away to the set of the film \"Superman.\" They were starstruck when they met Marlon Brando, who received 4 million dollars for his 10 minutes on screen as Jor-El, Superman's father. The children marveled at the elaborate sets and special effects, realizing the power of imagination and storytelling.\n\nFinally, the Magic School Bus took the children to a cricket match, where they learned about the sport's unique terminology. They discovered that a score of 111 was known as a \"Nelson,\" named after Admiral Lord Nelson, who was believed to have had one eye, one arm, and one leg. The children cheered as the players reached this iconic score, feeling a sense of camaraderie and excitement.\n\nAs the day came to an end, the Magic School Bus returned the children to their homes, their minds filled with the incredible experiences they had shared. They knew that the world of television was vast and magical, and they would never forget their journey on the Magic School Bus."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which ITV magazine style show ran from 1968 to 1980 and featured presenters including Jenny Hanley, Mick Robertson and Tommy Boyd?", "Which type of animal was Robin Hood in the Disney cartoon film 'Robin Hood'?", "Who provided the voice for Bob The Builder on his number one hit Can We Fix It?", "Which actor received 4 million dollars for his 10 minutes on screen in the film Superman?", "In cricket, what is the score of 111 known as?"], "answers": [["Chatterpie", "Magpie", "Magpies", "magpie", "magpies", "chatterpie"], ["Vulpine", "Vixen", "Todde", "Vulpini", "Fox", "Foxes", "Fox penis", "River fox", "Fox habitat", "Focks", "Foxp", "Fox (zoology)", "Foxs", "Sexual characteristics of foxes", "fox habitat", "vulpini", "focks", "foxs", "vulpine", "fox zoology", "sexual characteristics of foxes", "foxes", "fox penis", "foxp", "vixen", "todde", "fox", "river fox"], ["Neil morisey", "Neil Morrisy", "Neil A.

The celebrities' team included members of the Australian soccer team that had once beaten American Samoa 31-0 in a qualifying match for the 2002 World Cup but still failed to qualify. The locals were excited to play against such skilled opponents, even though they knew the odds were against them.\n\nDuring the halftime show, Roland Rat, a popular TV character, entertained the crowd with his antics. He was accompanied by his gerbil friend, Kevin, who was a big hit with the children in the audience.\n\nOne of the main attractions at the event was an educational booth about animals with extraordinary gestation periods. The booth featured information about elephants, which have the longest gestation period at around 22 months. This fact fascinated the visitors, who were eager to learn more about these majestic creatures.\n\nAmong the attendees was a famous actor, Steve Bing, who had dated actress Elizabeth Hurley between 2000 and 2001.

The Care Bears were amazed by this historical fact and wondered what it would be like to travel on a train.\n\nDuring their game, the Care Bears took a break to watch a movie together. They chose the 1994 film \"Frankenstein,\" starring Kenneth Branagh as the iconic character. The Care Bears were captivated by the story and appreciated the performance of the talented actor.\n\nAs the movie ended, Cheer Bear shared a fun fact about the first person to sell one million records. She told her friends that it was none other than Enrico Caruso, an Italian opera singer. The Care Bears were impressed by this achievement and decided to listen to some of his music.\n\nAs the day came to an end, the Care Bears gathered around Bedtime Bear, who shared a story from Greek mythology. He told them about the Elysian Fields, a place where righteous souls go after death. The Care Bears were touched by the beauty of this myth and felt grateful for the love and kindness they shared with one another.\n\nWith their hearts full of joy, the Care Bears continued to play billiards and enjoy each other's company, cherishing the moments they spent together in their magical land."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 3, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What sport or pastime would you be playing if your balls were black and blue and your opponent's were red and yellow?", "The age of the railway began in which year with the introduction of the Liverpool-Manchester line?", "Who played Frankenstein in the 1994 film of the same name?", "Who was the first person to sell one million records?", "In Greek mythology, where do righteous souls go after death?"], "answers": [["Croquet mallet", "Lead off striker", "Croquet ball", "Association croquet", "Croquet", "Association Croquet", "lead off striker", "association croquet", "croquet", "croquet ball", "croquet mallet"], ["1830", "one thousand, eight hundred and thirty", "one thousand eight hundred and thirty", "1830"], ["Kenneth Charles Branagh", "Branagh", "Ken Branagh", "Kenneth Brannagh", "Kenneth Brannaugh", "Sir Kenneth Branagh", "Branagh, Kenneth", "Kenneth Branagh", "kenneth brannagh", "kenneth charles branagh", "branagh", "branagh kenneth", "kenneth branagh", "sir kenneth branagh", "ken branagh", "kenneth brannaugh"], ["Errico Caruso", "Enrico Caruso", "Enrique Caruso", "errico caruso", "enrico caruso", "enrique caruso"], ["Alysian fields", "Elysian Fields", "Elysian Fields (disambiguation)", "The Elysian Fields", "Elysiane fields", "Elysian fields", "alysian fields", "elysian fields", "elysiane fields", "elysian fields disambiguation"]], "question_ids": ["qz_2355", "qz_2379", "qz_2384", "qz_2391", "qz_2397"], "topic": "Care Bears"}}

The Bakugan were eager to prove their worth in this prestigious location, known for its thrilling and challenging sports events.\n\nAs the Bakugan prepared for the tournament, they encountered a peculiar creature called the wireworm. Contrary to what its name might suggest, the wireworm was not a Bakugan but an insect, specifically the larva of the click beetle. The wireworm was intrigued by the Bakugan and their abilities, and it decided to join them on their journey to St. Moritz.\n\nUpon arriving in St. Moritz, the Bakugan were greeted by a Canadian-born actress named Pamela Anderson, who had starred in the movie \"Barb Wire.\" Pamela was a fan of the Bakugan and had come to support them in the tournament. She was excited to see the Bakugan compete and showcase their incredible powers.\n\nAs the tournament commenced, the Bakugan battled fiercely, displaying their unique abilities and strengths. The event was so captivating that it caught the attention of the creators of South Park, who had recently made a \"puppet\" movie called \"Team America: World Police\" in 2004. The movie satirized American politics and jingoism, and the creators saw potential in the Bakugan's story for a similar satire.\n\nInspired by the Bakugan's tournament, the creators decided to make a new movie that would incorporate the Bakugan's adventures and the answers to the five questions that had brought them all together. The movie became a hit, and the Bakugan's story was shared with the world, bringing joy and excitement to everyone who watched it."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Who played the character Mrs. Merton on TV?", "At which Winter Olympic host city would you find the Cresta Run?", "What kind of an animal is a wireworm?", "Which Canadian born  actress was the star in the movie Barb Wire?", "Which 2004 \"puppet\" movie, made by the makers of South Park, satirises Americas politics and jingoism?"], "answers": [["Caroline Hook", "Caroline Aherne", "Mrs Murton", "Mrs. Murton", "mrs murton", "caroline hook", "caroline aherne"], ["St. Moritz (Graub\u00fcnden)", "Saint Moritz", "San Moritz", "San Murezzan", "St.-Moritz", "St. Moritz GR", "St. Moritz", "St-Moritz", "St.Moritz", "St Moritz", "Sankt-Moritz", "Saint-Moritz", "Sankt Moritz", "St. Moritz (Graubuenden)", "St. Moritz, Switzerland", "St. Mortitz", "St. Moritz (Grisons)", "St. Moritz (Graubunden)", "st moritz switzerland", "st moritz grisons", "san moritz", "st moritz", "st moritz graub\u00fcnden", "st moritz graubuenden", "saint moritz", "sankt moritz", "st moritz graubunden", "st mortitz", "san murezzan", "st moritz gr"], ["The Beetle", "The beetle", "Beetle (disambiguation)", "A Beetle", "beetle disambiguation", "beetle"], ["Pamela Anderson", "Pamela Lee", "Pamula Anderson", "Pam anderson", "Pam Anderson", "Pamela Denise Anderson", "Pamela Anderson Lee", "Pam Andreson", "Pamala anderson", "Pamela Lee Anderson", "Pamela anderson", "Pamela Anderson House", "Miss february 1990", "Pamela andersson", "pamela lee", "pamula anderson", "pam andreson", "pamala anderson", "pamela lee anderson", "pamela anderson", "pamela andersson", "miss february 1990", "pamela anderson lee", "pamela anderson house", "pam anderson", "pamela denise anderson"], ["America, fuck yeah", "Team America: World Police.", "Durkadurkistan", "Team America World Police", "I'm So Ronery", "Film Actors Guild", "Valmorification", "Derkaderkistan", "America Fuck Yeah", "Durkadurkastan", "Derka derka", "Team america world police", "Derkaderkastan", "Chris (Team America)", "Team America: World Police (film)", "Dirkadirkastan", "Derka", "TAWP", "Ronery", "America, Fuck Yeah", "America, Fuck Yeah!", "Dirka", "Dirkadirkistan", "America, F**k Yeah!", "Dirkastan", "America - Fuck Yeah!", "America, F**k Yeah", "America fuck yeah", "America, Fuck Yeah (Bummer Remix)", "Team America: World Police", "America world police", "america f k yeah", "durkadurkistan", "dirkadirkastan", "america world police", "tawp", "derka", "america fuck yeah", "chris team america", "ronery", "valmorification", "team america world police film", "durkadurkastan", "dirka", "derkaderkistan", "dirkastan", "film actors guild", "derka derka", "team america world police", "derkaderkastan", "america fuck yeah bummer remix", "i m so ronery", "dirkadirkistan"]], "question_ids": ["qz_3557", "qz_3570", "qz_3583", "qz_3623", "qz_3644"], "topic": "Bakugan"}}

The Doctor, intrigued by Moana's quest, decided to join her on her journey.\n\nAs they sailed across the vast ocean, the Doctor shared stories of his adventures through time and space. He told Moana about the legendary Rings of Power, of which there were twenty in total. Moana, fascinated by the tale, wondered if these rings could help her save her people.\n\nOne day, they arrived at a mysterious island where everything was a beautiful shade of heliotrope, a common color also known as purple. The island was inhabited by a tribe who worshipped the heliotrope color, believing it brought them good fortune and protection.\n\nOn this island, they met a woman named Michelle Ryan, who had left her successful career in Eastenders to pursue her dreams in Hollywood. Unfortunately, her role as The Bionic Woman did not bring her the success she had hoped for.

Gru was impressed by Basso's skills and invited him to join his team.\n\nThe second competition was a sprint, modeled after the Commonwealth Games in Delhi. Gru was amazed by the performance of British athlete Leon Baptiste, who had won the men's 200m gold medal. Gru knew that Baptiste's speed would be an asset to his team, so he invited him to join as well.\n\nDuring the preparations, Gru wanted to create a motivational anthem for his team. He heard about a talented singer named Lily Allen, who had recently won three Ivor Novello awards, including songwriter of the year for her hit single, \"The Fear.\" Gru contacted Lily and asked her to compose a song for his team of minions.\n\nAs the team trained, Gru decided to take a break and visit a historical site for inspiration. He traveled to Shottery in Warwickshire, where he visited the cottage of Anne Hathaway, the wife of William Shakespeare. Gru was fascinated by the history and romance of the place, which gave him new ideas for his grand plan.\n\nFinally, as the day of the heist approached, Gru gathered his team and played their motivational anthem. To his surprise, the theme song for the TV show 'Rawhide,' sung by Frankie Laine, started playing. The minions had accidentally mixed up the songs, but Gru couldn't help but laugh at the situation. The team, now more united than ever, embarked on their mission to steal the moon, with the spirit of champions and the support of their newfound friends."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Who won the 2010 Giro D'Italia?", "In the Commonwealth games in Delhi, which British athlete won the mens 200m gold medal?", "Which singer picked up three Ivor Novello awards in May, including songwriter of the year for her hit single, The Fear?", "Which famous woman in history had a cottage in Shottery in Warwickshire?", "Who sang the theme song for the TV show 'Rawhide'?"], "answers": [["Ivan Basso", "ivan basso"], ["Leon Baptiste", "leon baptiste"], ["Lily Loves", "Lily Allen (band)", "Lilly Allan", "Lily Allan", "Is It Scary (album)", "Lily Rose Beatrice Allen", "Lily allen", "Sheezus Tour", "Lilly allen", "Lilly Allen", "Lily Rose Beatrice Cooper", "Lily Allen", "Lily Cooper", "Lily alen", "Maggie May (dog)", "Still, Alright Tour", "Lily Alan", "Lilyallenmusic.com", "Lily Rose Cooper", "Lilly Rose Cooper", "lily loves", "still alright tour", "is it scary album", "lily allen", "lilyallenmusic com", "lily alen", "lily allan", "lilly allan", "lily rose beatrice cooper", "lily cooper", "lilly rose cooper", "sheezus tour", "lilly allen", "maggie may dog", "lily alan", "lily allen band", "lily rose beatrice allen", "lily rose cooper"], ["The Hathaway effect", "The hathaway effect", "Anne Hathaway (actress)", "Anne Jacqueline Hathaway", "Anne hathaway (actress)", "Adam Shulman", "Anne Hathaway filmography", "Annie Hathaway", "Anne Hathaway (actor)", "Anne Hathaway", "Anne hathaway", "Hathaway effect", "anne hathaway actor", "anne hathaway filmography", "adam shulman", "hathaway effect", "anne hathaway", "anne hathaway actress", "anne jacqueline hathaway", "annie hathaway"], ["Francesco Paolo LoVecchio", "Francesco Lovecchio", "Francesco P.

This artifact was none other than the Holy Grail, said to be housed in a mysterious building in Scotland called Rosslyn Chapel. This chapel was known to many as the prominent location featured at the end of The Da Vinci Code.\n\nIntrigued by the legend, Firenze decided to embark on a journey to find the Holy Grail.

Inside, he discovered a statue of a 5th/6th Century Buddhist monk, known in Chinese texts as \"The Blue-Eyed Barbarian.\" Intrigued by the monk's story, Bono decided to incorporate the tale into his music.\n\nDuring his stay in Bolt, Bono learned about a dark chapter in the town's history. In 1972, the only hijacking of a British commercial flight occurred, leaving the townspeople shaken and fearful. Bono was moved by the resilience of the community and decided to write a song about their strength in the face of adversity.\n\nAs Bono's time in Bolt came to an end, he was invited to a special event commemorating the launch of a Cunard ocean liner named Lusitania. The ship had been launched on September 20th, 1906, and was a symbol of the town's connection to the sea and the world beyond.\n\nInspired by the stories and experiences he encountered in Bolt, Bono returned to his band with a newfound sense of purpose. He went on to create an album that celebrated the spirit of the town, its legendary steam locomotive, the ancient Buddhist monk, the resilience of the community, and the majestic ocean liner. The album became a worldwide sensation, and the town of Bolt would forever be remembered as the place that inspired a musical masterpiece."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 1, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "standard", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["What is the name of the steam locomotive which set the world speed record in July 1938 by reaching 126 mph on the East Coast Mainline  in England?", "Singer and musician Bono called which venue \u2018Rock and roll\u2019s great cathedral\u2019?", "Which 5th/6th Century Buddhist monk is described in Chinese texts as \u2018The Blue-Eyed Barbarian\u2019?", "Which year saw the only hijacking of a British commercial flight?", "What was the name of the Cunard ocean liner which was launched on 20th September 1906?"], "answers": [["Mallard Duck", "Mallards", "Platyrhynchos", "Mallard duck", "Anas platyrhynchos", "Anas boschas", "Mallard", "Wild Duck", "Stock Duck", "Wild Ducks", "Mallard ducks", "anas platyrhynchos", "mallard ducks", "anas boschas", "mallards", "wild duck", "stock duck", "mallard", "mallard duck", "platyrhynchos", "wild ducks"], ["Madison square garden", "Madison Square Garden IV", "The MSG", "M.S.G.", "Knicks\u2013Rangers Finals series of 1994", "Knicks\u2013Rangers Championship runs of 1994", "Madison Square Gardens", "Theatre at Madison Square", "Gilmores Garden", "Madison Square Garden 4", "Madison Square Garden", "Knicks-Rangers Finals Series of 1994", "MSG IV", "The M.S.G.", "Madison Square Garden (1968)", "Knicks-Rangers Championship runs of 1994", "Madison Garden", "Knicks-Rangers Finals series of 1994", "Madison Square Garden Training Center", "knicks rangers finals series of 1994", "m s g", "knicks\u2013rangers championship runs of 1994", "knicks\u2013rangers finals series of 1994", "madison garden", "msg iv", "madison square garden 1968", "madison square garden iv", "madison square garden training center", "madison square garden", "madison square gardens", "theatre at madison square", "knicks rangers championship runs of 1994", "gilmores garden", "msg", "madison square garden 4"], ["Da mo", "Bodhi-Dharma", "Tamo", "Bodidarma", "Bodhiharma", "Da Mo's cave", "Bodhidarma", "Bodhi Dharma", "Bodhidharma at Shaolin", "Bloodstream Sermon", "Bodhidharma", "bodidarma", "da mo s cave", "bodhidarma", "bloodstream sermon", "bodhi dharma", "tamo", "da mo", "bodhiharma", "bodhidharma", "bodhidharma at shaolin"], ["one thousand, nine hundred and seventy", "1970", "1970", "one thousand nine hundred and seventy"], ["Domain of Moor", "Mauretania Secunda", "Roman Mauretania", "Mauretanian Kingdom", "Ancient mauretania", "Kingdom of Mauretania", "Roman-Moorish kingdoms", "Roman-Moor Kingdoms", "Mauretania Prima", "List of Kings of Mauretania", "King of Mauretania", "Classical mauretania", "Mauretania Sitifensis", "Classical morocco", "Mauretania", "List of kings of Mauretania", "Sitifensis", "mauretania prima", "domain of moor", "classical morocco", "sitifensis", "king of mauretania", "mauretanian kingdom", "list of kings of mauretania", "roman moorish kingdoms", "roman moor kingdoms", "ancient mauretania", "classical mauretania", "mauretania sitifensis", "mauretania secunda", "kingdom of mauretania", "roman mauretania", "mauretania"]], "question_ids": ["qb_404", "qb_406", "qb_470", "qb_483", "qb_495"], "topic": "Bolt"}}
