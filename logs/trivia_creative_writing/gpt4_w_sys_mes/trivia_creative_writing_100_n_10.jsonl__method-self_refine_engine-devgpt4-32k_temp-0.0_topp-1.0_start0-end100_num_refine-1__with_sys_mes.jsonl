Mario was excited to perform at one of the Olympic events, representing the only Eastern Bloc country participating in the games.\n\nMario lived on a street that inspired him every day. It was the same street where the famous musical \"My Fair Lady\" was set, featuring the song \"The Street Where You Live.\" As he walked down the street, he would hum the tune and dream of his future success.\n\nOne day, Mario received a mysterious letter from a man named Stansfield Turner, who claimed to be the director of the CIA from 1976-81. The letter mentioned a failed \"Bomb Plot\" of 1944, targeting Adolf Hitler, and hinted that Mario's performance at the Olympics could be in danger. Mario was puzzled but decided to focus on his music and not let fear hold him back.\n\nAs he prepared for his performance, Mario found inspiration in the music of the 80s, particularly the number one hit \"Hold On To The Nights\" by Richard Marx. He also admired the work of John Ford, who directed the classic 30s western \"Stagecoach.\" Mario believed that combining different styles and eras could create a unique sound that would captivate the audience.\n\nMario was also a fan of rock music and looked up to Dave Gilmore and Roger Waters, members of the legendary rock group Pink Floyd. He would often listen to their music while driving down the highway, especially the classic 60s album \"Highway 61 Revisited\" by Bob Dylan.\n\nAs the day of his performance approached, Mario discovered a 90s sci-fi series called \"Wild Palms,\" starring James Belushi and based on Bruce Wagner's comic strip of the same name. The show's futuristic setting and innovative storytelling fueled Mario's creativity, and he incorporated some of its themes into his music.\n\nFinally, the day of the Olympic performance arrived. Mario took the stage, his heart pounding with excitement and nerves. As he began to play, the audience was captivated by his unique blend of musical styles and eras. The performance was a huge success, and Mario's dreams of becoming a famous musician were finally coming true.\n\nIn the end, the mysterious letter from Stansfield Turner proved to be a false alarm, and Mario's performance went off without a hitch.

The song's uplifting rhythm and message of resilience resonated with Simba, inspiring him to continue his journey.\n\nAs Simba ventured on, he came across a poster for MC Hammer's \"Too Legit To Quit Tour.\" Intrigued by the catchy phrase and energetic performance, he decided to attend the concert. There, he met a wise old owl who shared a quote from Rudyard Kipling about treating \"triumph and disaster\" as two imposters to be met and treated the same. The owl's wisdom taught Simba the importance of maintaining balance and perspective in life.\n\nInspired by the wisdom, Simba ventured to the United States, where he discovered the most successful UK solo artist in the USA, Sir Elton John. Simba was amazed by the talent and success of the musician, and as he listened to Elton's powerful ballads and heartfelt lyrics, he decided to learn more about the world's diverse cultures.\n\nSimba's journey took him to Angola, where he encountered the airline TAAG. He marveled at the planes soaring through the sky and decided to take a flight. During his travels, he listened to Diana Ross's US No. 1 single \"Upside Down\" from her platinum album \"Diana,\" which quickly became one of his favorite songs. The upbeat tune and Diana's captivating voice filled Simba with a sense of joy and wonder.\n\nWhile in the United States, Simba learned about the tragic death of River Phoenix during the making of the movie \"Dark Blood.\" The story reminded him of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing every moment. This realization deepened Simba's appreciation for the diverse experiences and stories he encountered on his journey.\n\nAs Simba's journey came to an end, he found himself in Australia, where he met a kangaroo named Mel Gibson. Mel shared stories of his adventures and revealed that his middle name was Columcille. Simba was fascinated by the unique name and the tales of Mel's travels, which painted a vivid picture of the Australian landscape and its rich culture.\n\nWith a newfound appreciation for the world and its diverse cultures, Simba returned to the Pride Lands, eager to share his experiences and the wisdom he had gained with his family and friends. Through his journey, Simba learned the importance of embracing life's triumphs and disasters, cherishing every moment, and celebrating the beauty of the world's diverse cultures. This profound understanding brought Simba closer to becoming the wise and compassionate king he was destined to be."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 10, "question_count": 10}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In which state was Gene Vincent born?", "Brandon Lee died during the making of which movie?", "Who had a 70s No 1 hit with Let's Do It Again?", "Who had a Too Legit To Quit Tour?", "\"According to Rudyard Kipling what were the \"\"two imposters\"\" to meet and treat the same day?\"", "Who is the most successful UK solo artist in the USA?", "Which country does the airline TAAG come from?", "Which US No 1 single came from Diana Ross's platinum album Diana?", "River Phoenix died during the making of which movie?", "What is Mel Gibson's middle name?"], "answers": [["US-VA", "State of Virginia", "Virginia, USA", "Tenth State", "Religion in Virginia", "Virginia (USA state)", "Virginia (state)", "Commonwealth of VA", "Rest of Virginia", "Virginia", "Mother of Presidents", "Virginia (USA State)", "The Old Dominion", "VA (state)", "Commonwealth of Virginia", "Virginian Commonwealth", "The Mother of Presidents", "Virginia, United States", "Council of Virginia", "Sports in Virginia", "Viginia", "Virginia (U.S. state)", "10th State", "Virgina", "The Commonwealth of Virginia", "VA, USA", "Virginia (State)", "commonwealth of virginia", "sports in virginia", "va state", "rest of virginia", "va usa", "virginia usa state", "10th state", "virginian commonwealth", "us va", "tenth state", "viginia", "commonwealth of va", "mother of presidents", "virginia", "virginia united states", "council of virginia", "virginia usa", "virgina", "old dominion", "state of virginia", "religion in virginia", "virginia state", "virginia u s state"], ["The Crow: Dead Time", "The Crow (2016 film)", "The Crow", "crow", "crow dead time", "crow 2016 film"], ["The Staple Singers", "Staple Singers", "The Staples Singers", "Staples Singers", "Cleotha Staples", "cleotha staples", "staple singers", "staples singers"], ["M.

As he passed by a movie theater, he noticed a poster for \"The Man of La Mancha,\" starring Peter O'Toole. He remembered watching the film with his Aunt May and how much they both enjoyed it.\n\nWhile on patrol, Spider-Man overheard a conversation between two women discussing their favorite actresses. One of them mentioned Vanessa Redgrave, and the other mentioned her niece, Joey Richardson. Intrigued by their conversation, Spider-Man decided to learn more about the Redgrave family's acting legacy.\n\nAs he continued his patrol, Spider-Man spotted a billboard featuring Melanie Molitor, the mother of tennis world No. 1, Martina Hingis. He admired the dedication and hard work it took for both mother and daughter to achieve such success in the world of tennis.\n\nSuddenly, Spider-Man's attention was drawn to a news report about a horrifying case in Belgium involving Marc Dutroux and his 'house of horrors.'

Each riddle contained a clue that would lead Batman to the next location, ultimately revealing the Riddler's sinister plan.\n\nThe first riddle led Batman to a warehouse where he discovered a collection of baby strollers. He recalled that in the late 60s, Owen Finlay MacLaren had pioneered the modern folding baby stroller, a useful item for parents of small children. Batman deduced that the Riddler was targeting families and continued his search.\n\nThe second riddle brought Batman to the docks, where he found a shipyard similar to the one in Gdansk, Poland, where the Solidarity movement was set up. Batman realized that the Riddler was trying to create chaos and division within Gotham.\n\nThe third riddle mentioned a female singer who shared a birthday with impressionist Rich Little. Batman quickly identified the singer as Tina Turner and headed to a concert venue where she was scheduled to perform.\n\nAt the concert, Batman discovered the fourth riddle, which referenced Mark McGwire breaking Roger Maris' home run record in the 1998 season. Batman rushed to the Gotham City baseball stadium, fearing an attack during a game.\n\nUpon arriving at the stadium, Batman found the fifth riddle, which mentioned the Philadelphia Phillies winning the first World Series of the 80s. He noticed a pattern in the riddles and realized that the Riddler was leading him to different sports venues.\n\nThe sixth riddle mentioned Pete Sampras, who was seeded 12th when he won his first US Open. Batman headed to the Gotham City Tennis Center, where he found the seventh riddle.\n\nThis riddle quoted a famous boxer, Rocky Marciano, who said, \"If I can't beat this bum, take my name off the record books.\" Batman raced to the Gotham City Boxing Club, where he found the eighth riddle.\n\nThe eighth riddle referenced Jonathan Edwards setting his 1995 triple jump world record in Gothenburg, Sweden. Batman went to the Gotham City Athletics Stadium, where he found the ninth riddle.\n\nThis riddle mentioned the nickname of super athlete Michael Johnson, who was known as the \"Road Runner\" due to his incredible speed.

Superman frowned, remembering the unfortunate incident, and replied that she was banned for four years.\n\nYuan Yuan was caught carrying drugs for a Chinese team, and Superman knew that it was the Chinese women's volleyball team. Finally, the group asked which grand slam Pete Sampras did not win in the 20th century. Superman thought back to Sampras's impressive career and answered, \"The French Open.\"\n\nWith all their questions answered, the group thanked Superman for his help.

She was fascinated by the world above the sea and often dreamt of exploring it. One day, while swimming near the surface, Ariel overheard a conversation between two sailors. They were discussing the recent acrimonious divorce settlement of Earl Spencer, which was heard in England. Intrigued by the human world, Ariel decided to learn more about it.\n\nAriel swam to the surface and met a wise old sea turtle named Charlie. Charlie had traveled far and wide and knew many things about the human world. He told Ariel about the founders of United Artists, one of whom had the last name nearest the beginning of the alphabet - Charlie Chaplin. Ariel was fascinated by the world of cinema and wanted to learn more.\n\nCharlie told her about a famous movie called La Cage Aux Folles. In the movie, La Cage Aux Folles was a nightclub where the main characters performed. Ariel was amazed by the idea of a place where people could gather to sing, dance, and be entertained.\n\nAs they continued their conversation, Charlie mentioned that Europe covered only 6.8% of the Earth's surface.

He invited guests from all around the world, including a group of penguins from Antarctica. The penguins were excited to share their favorite pastime, golf, with their new friends. They brought along their special orange golf balls, which were used on the icy golf courses in Antarctica to make them easier to spot.\n\nAs the celebration began, Simba arranged for a live concert featuring some of the greatest musicians from different eras. Phil Collins, who had recorded on the Atlantic Records label throughout the 80s and 90s, was one of the headliners. He was joined by a hologram of Chuck Berry, who had recorded on the Chess Records label in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nDuring the concert, a surprise guest appeared: Debbie Rowe, Michael Jackson's second wife. She shared stories of her life with the King of Pop and expressed her love for the animal kingdom. The crowd was thrilled to have her as part of the celebration.\n\nThe event also featured a trivia contest, with questions about various topics. One question asked which US city was named after a British Prime Minister. The answer was Pittsburgh, named after William Pitt the Elder. Another question was about a famous quote: \"To err is human, but it feels divine.\" The crowd correctly identified the author as Mae West.\n\nThe concert continued with a performance by Bobby Vinton, who had a big 60s No. 1 hit with \"Roses Are Red.\" The audience sang along, creating a beautiful atmosphere of unity and joy.\n\nAs the celebration went on, a group of animals from Iceland arrived, driving a vehicle with the international registration letters \"IS.\" They were warmly welcomed by Simba and the other guests.\n\nThe grand finale of the event was a live broadcast of the Live Aid concert from its American venue, which took place at the John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia. The animals were mesmerized by the performances and the spirit of unity that transcended borders.\n\nAs the night came to an end, the animals gathered to watch a documentary about the longest moon landing, Apollo 17. They marveled at the achievements of humankind and felt inspired to continue building connections and friendships across the animal kingdom.\n\nAnd so, the Lion King's celebration became a symbol of unity, love, and the power of music and knowledge to bring everyone together. The story showcased the importance of embracing diversity and learning from one another, creating a memorable event that would be cherished by all who attended."], "parsing_success_flag": [true],

One day, they stumbled upon a magical book hidden in Andy's room that could answer any question they asked. Excited by this discovery, they decided to ask the book ten questions to expand their knowledge and better understand the humans they loved so much.\n\nTheir first question was about Israel's head of state in 1993. The book revealed that it was Yitzhak Rabin who held the position. Intrigued by history, they asked about the head of the Nazi party's security service during WWII. The book informed them that it was Heinrich Himmler. Woody and Buzz were amazed by the book's ability to provide such detailed information.\n\nThe toys then wondered about the geography of the United States. They asked which state on the Gulf of Mexico was nearest the end of the alphabet. The book answered, \"Texas.\" They also inquired about the location of Truax Field International Airport, learning that it was in Wisconsin. Buzz was particularly fascinated by the vastness of the human world.\n\nCurious about sports, Woody and Buzz asked how many of the 23 track and field titles were won by Americans in the 1904 Olympics. The book proudly stated that Americans had won 21 of those titles. They also learned about the Black Hills, which lie between the Cheyenne and Belle Fourche rivers. Woody couldn't believe the incredible achievements of the human athletes.\n\nThe toys' interest in human achievements led them to ask about the first in-flight movie shown on an internal flight in the USA. The book told them it happened in 1921. They also discovered that Jack Ruby had shot Lee Harvey Oswald in November 1963. Buzz was astonished by the advancements in technology and the complexity of human history.\n\nAs they continued their quest for knowledge, Woody and Buzz asked about the first American to travel faster than the speed of sound. The book revealed that it was Chuck Yeager who accomplished this feat. Finally, they inquired about the first US president interviewed by Barbara Walters. The book informed them that it was Richard Nixon. The toys marveled at the courage and determination of the humans they admired.\n\nWith their newfound knowledge, Woody and Buzz returned to their friends in the toy box, eager to share the fascinating stories they had learned about the human world. The magical book had brought them closer to understanding the world beyond their toy box, and they couldn't wait to embark on more adventures together. As they shared their discoveries with their fellow toys, Woody and Buzz felt a deeper connection to the humans they cherished and a greater appreciation for the world they inhabited."],

As he delved into his ancestry, he discovered fascinating connections to various historical events, places, and people. Inspired by these discoveries, Shrek decided to throw a grand celebration that would honor his newfound heritage and share it with his friends and family.\n\nShrek learned that his distant cousin was married to a famous orchestral conductor, who had been featured in the film Hillary and Jackie. Excited by this connection to the world of music, Shrek planned a musical extravaganza for the celebration.\n\nAs he researched his family tree, Shrek found out that one of his ancestors was a fan of Tarzan, whose first novel was published in 1912. To honor this, he created a Tarzan-themed playground for the children to enjoy.\n\nShrek also wanted to pay tribute to the United Kingdom, the country where motorized ambulances were first used. He arranged for a replica of an early motorized ambulance to be displayed at the party, surrounded by lush greenery reminiscent of the British countryside.\n\nIn his research, Shrek came across the Syrian city of Damascus, said to be the oldest continually inhabited city in the world. Inspired by its rich history, he decided to have a section of the party dedicated to the culture and cuisine of Damascus, complete with colorful tapestries and aromatic spices.\n\nShrek's friend Donkey suggested they include a replica of the famous Saint Basil's Cathedral in Red Square, Moscow. Shrek agreed, thinking it would add a touch of grandeur to the celebration. They set up the replica as the centerpiece of the party, its vibrant colors and intricate design captivating the guests.\n\nAs the guest list grew, Shrek discovered that one of his ancestors was related to Catherine Parr, the wife of Henry VIII who had already married twice before becoming queen and married for a fourth time after Henry's death. Shrek decided to invite some of her descendants to the party and created a Tudor-themed dining area for them to enjoy.\n\nShrek's friend Fiona had always been fascinated by the Habsburg dynasty, so Shrek arranged for a replica of the castle in Austria that gave the dynasty its name to be built as a backdrop for the main stage, where musicians and performers would entertain the guests.\n\nThe entertainment for the evening included a debate among the guests, who were elected for a five-year term in the UK's 87-seat parliament. They discussed the \"simple plurality\" system of voting, more commonly known as \"first-past-the-post,\" while the audience listened intently.\n\nFinally, as a tribute to the French singer Edith Piaf, nicknamed \"The Little Sparrow,\" Shrek hired a talented singer to perform some of her most famous songs under a canopy of twinkling lights.\n\nThe celebration was a huge success, with guests from all over the world coming together to enjoy the unique blend of history, culture, and entertainment. The atmosphere was filled with laughter, music, and the aroma of delicious food from various regions. And as the night came to an end, Shrek, Fiona, and their friends looked forward to their next great adventure, knowing that their shared history had brought them even closer together."],

By emitting a frequency that interfered with the sinoatrial node, they were able to neutralize Vaporizer's powers temporarily. With his powers neutralized, Vaporizer was captured, and the stolen silica sand was returned to its rightful place.\n\nThe city of Materia was saved, and the Incredibles once again proved that knowledge, teamwork, and the power of family could overcome any challenge.

His favorite was a 1993 film called \"Sleepless in Seattle,\" where a boy named Jonah writes to a woman named Annie, asking her to meet his father at the Empire State Building on St. Valentine's Day. Jonah would often hum the tune of \"Valentine,\" a top ten hit from 1988 by T'Pau, as he wandered the desolate streets of his district.\n\nOne day, Jonah stumbled upon an old, abandoned arcade filled with relics from a time long gone. The second most common word in written English, \"of,\" was scrawled across the entrance, piquing his curiosity. Inside, he discovered a game featuring ghosts called Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Clyde, known as \"Pac-Man.\" The game provided a much-needed escape from the harsh reality of his life.\n\nJonah also found a tattered copy of \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" which inspired the cult film \"Blade Runner,\" starring Harrison Ford. He became fascinated with the idea of a world where androids and humans coexisted.

Which Eastenders actor has played the policeman Nick Rowan on TV? What type of animal was Boris, the subject of a song by The Who? Which brand of beer does Homer Simpson drink regularly? In which film was the song White Christmas first sung? Which Pop Idol had a number one hit in 2004 called All This Time?\n\nIn the mystical land of Middle-earth, a tennis tournament was held in the Shire to celebrate the unity of all races. The grand finale was between Frodo Baggins and an English-born player named Fred Perry, who had once won the men's singles title at Wimbledon. The match was intense, and at one point, a let occurred, which meant the point had to be replayed.\n\nAs the match continued, the spectators were entertained by a performance from the cast of the popular show, Prisoner: Cell Block H, which had a total of 692 episodes. Among the audience was a young gymnast named Luigina Giavotti, who had won a silver medal in gymnastics in 1928 at the age of 11 years and 302 days, making her the youngest medal winner to this day.\n\nDuring the halftime break, the legendary gymnast Nadia Com\u0103neci, who scored 7 maximum scores of 10 in the 1976 Olympics, winning three gold medals, one silver, and one bronze, gave an awe-inspiring performance. The crowd was also thrilled to see Nick Berry, an Eastenders actor who played the policeman Nick Rowan on TV, make a guest appearance.\n\nAs the event progressed, the audience enjoyed a special performance by The Who, who sang a song about Boris, a spider that had once accompanied them on their adventures. To quench their thirst, the spectators drank Duff beer, the same brand that Homer Simpson drinks regularly.\n\nIn a surprising twist, the tournament ended with a musical performance by a Pop Idol named Michelle McManus, who sang her number one hit from 2004, \"All This Time.\" As the sun set, the crowd gathered around a large screen to watch the film \"Holiday Inn,\" where the song \"White Christmas\" was first sung.\n\nThe day was filled with excitement, camaraderie, and the celebration of unity in Middle-earth, as the Lord of the Rings characters and real-world figures came together for a truly unforgettable event.\n---\nFeedback: The response is creative and engaging, successfully incorporating all the answers to the 10 questions into a coherent story set in the Lord of the Rings universe. The information provided is accurate, and the story flows well, making it an enjoyable read. The blending of real-world figures and fictional characters adds a unique touch to the story.\n\nOne possible improvement could be to make the transitions between the different elements of the story smoother, as some parts may feel slightly disjointed. Additionally, the story could benefit from a more conclusive ending, tying the events together and providing a sense of closure. Overall, the response is well-executed and entertaining.\n---\nBased on your initial response and the subsequent feedback, revise the response.

They gathered in Snoopy's doghouse, which had been transformed into a cozy movie theater.\n\nAs the movie began, the first scene depicted the tragic story of Gianni Versace, the Italian fashion designer who was shot dead on the steps of his Miami mansion in 1997. The Peanuts gang felt a deep sense of loss for the talented designer.\n\nThe movie then transitioned to the 1920s, showcasing the elegance of Coco Chanel, who was famous for popularizing the 'little black dress.' The gang admired her timeless sense of style and her impact on the fashion world.\n\nNext, the movie featured a scene from Madonna's wedding to Guy Ritchie, highlighting the beautiful wedding dress designed by Stella McCartney. The Peanuts characters marveled at the intricate details of the gown.\n\nThe movie continued with a tribute to the TV show E.R., focusing on the character Dr. Doug Ross, played by George Clooney. The gang enjoyed watching the talented actor in one of his most memorable roles.\n\nIn another scene, the movie showcased the 1990 film Mermaids, with Winona Ryder playing the role of Kate Flax. The Peanuts characters were captivated by her performance and the unique storyline.\n\nThe movie then paid homage to the character Mrs. Merton, played by Caroline Aherne on TV. The Peanuts gang laughed at her witty humor and appreciated her contribution to television comedy.\n\nAs the movie progressed, the gang was transported to the Winter Olympic host city of St. Moritz, where they learned about the famous Cresta Run.

The Ghostbusters had recently helped the Smurfs defeat an evil spirit that had been haunting their village.\n\nDuring the preparations, Papa Smurf received a letter from the French President, Georges Pompidou, who had succeeded General Charles de Gaulle in 1969. President Pompidou invited the Smurfs and the Ghostbusters to visit France as a token of gratitude for their heroic deeds.\n\nExcited about the adventure, Mr. Benn, a friend of the Smurfs, decided to join them. He visited a magical costume shop to find the perfect outfit for the trip. While trying on different costumes, he stumbled upon a French chef's outfit and decided to wear it for the journey.\n\nIn France, the Smurfs and their friends were treated to a grand feast. Mr. Benn, now dressed as a chef, decided to prepare a traditional French cheese using an enzyme called rennet, which is added to milk to coagulate it and make \"curds and whey.\"\n\nAfter the feast, the group decided to explore London. They visited the Harrods department store, where the first escalators were installed in 1898. While exploring the store, they met a mysterious character who had been played by various actors, including Jack Lord, Cec Linder, Rik Van Nutter, Norman Burton, David Hedison, John Terry, David Hedison, and Jeffrey Wright. This character was none other than the famous secret agent, James Bond.\n\nJames Bond introduced the Smurfs and their friends to a magician named David Nixon, who had first introduced the world to the lovable fox puppet, Basil Brush. Together, they put on a magical show for the Smurfs and their friends, creating a memorable experience for everyone.\n\nDuring their adventure, the Smurfs learned about the only Prime Minister of Britain to be assassinated, Spencer Perceval, who was killed in 1812. They also discovered the beautiful chain of islands in the southwestern Philippines called the Sulu Archipelago.\n\nAs their journey came to an end, the Smurfs and their friends reflected on the tragic event of the ferry named Herald of Free Enterprise, which capsized after leaving Zeebrugge in 1987. They were grateful for the safe and enjoyable journey they had experienced together.\n\nThe Smurfs, Ghostbusters, Mr. Benn, James Bond, and Basil Brush returned to their respective homes, cherishing the memories of their incredible adventure.

They decided to host a trivia night at their home, inviting their friends and fellow superheroes to join in the fun.\n\nAs the guests arrived, Blossom prepared a round of Cuba Libre cocktails, made with rum, the spirit that the drink is based on. Bubbles, always eager to share her knowledge, mentioned that the Spitfire, a famous aircraft, was produced by the Supermarine company.\n\nThe trivia night began, and the first question was about music. Buttercup, a fan of classic tunes, quickly recognized the lyric \"Always sunny in a rich man's world\" as being from the song \"Money, Money, Money\" by ABBA. The next question was about sports, specifically the men's singles title at Wimbledon in 1987. Blossom, a tennis enthusiast, knew that Pat Cash was the winner that year.\n\nAs the night continued, the questions turned to the magical world. Bubbles, a fan of the Harry Potter series, knew that Victor Krum's wand was made by the wandmaker Gregorovitch. The next question was about mythical creatures, and Buttercup correctly identified Firenze as a centaur.\n\nThe trivia night took a turn towards literature and architecture, with a question about the building in Scotland said to house the Holy Grail and featured prominently at the end of The Da Vinci Code. Blossom knew that the building was Rosslyn Chapel. The next question was about television sitcoms, and Bubbles excitedly answered that Penelope Wilton played the wife of Richard Briers in the sitcom \"Ever Decreasing Circles.\"\n\nAs the night went on, the questions became more challenging.

On the sixth day, Princess Bride's true love brought her six geese a-laying, which she graciously shared with Anne Boleyn. The geese brought joy and laughter to their journey, making it even more memorable and teaching them the importance of generosity and sharing.\n\nBefore returning to their respective kingdoms, Princess Bride and Anne Boleyn attended the 2012 London Olympics, where they witnessed the talented gymnast Louis Smith win an individual silver medal for his exceptional performance in the pommel horse discipline. The event inspired them to appreciate the dedication and hard work required to achieve greatness.\n\nAnd so, with hearts full of unforgettable memories and newfound friendships, Princess Bride and Anne Boleyn returned to their homes, forever cherishing the magical journey they had shared. They had learned valuable lessons about justice, forgiveness, resilience, and the power of friendship, which they carried with them for the rest of their lives."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Captain Corelli's mandolin is a book a film set in which country", "The Bull is the village pub in an everyday tale of country folk.

The two formed a bond, and Bagheera decided to accompany Reggie to the Christmas Special.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Reggie and Bagheera finally reached their destination - the Morecambe and Wise Christmas Special. The venue was adorned with decorations inspired by the first Beatles film, \"A Hard Day's Night.\" The atmosphere was electric, and the guests eagerly anticipated the arrival of Harold Wilson.\n\nThe celebration took place at a replica of the famous Liverpool nightclub, The Cavern Club, where the Beatles regularly played. As Reggie and Bagheera entered the club, they couldn't help but smile, knowing that they were now a part of the extraordinary tapestry of stories that made up the magical land of NeverEnding Story. Together, they enjoyed the festivities, sharing their own tales and creating new memories that would become a part of the never-ending story of this enchanting realm."], "parsing_success_flag":

She was inspired by his innovative virtual online museum, launched in December 2011, and decided to create a similar virtual exhibit showcasing the ponies' adventures.\n\nAs the ponies continued to learn from the ancient scroll, they discovered the story of Aegeus, a character from Greek mythology. They were intrigued by the tale of his first wife, Meta, and decided to create a play reenacting their story for the party's entertainment.\n\nThe ponies also learned about a heartwarming movie called 'Marley and Me,' which featured a lovable Labrador Retriever. They decided to invite their own Labrador friend, named Sunny, to join the celebration and share the joy that dogs can bring.\n\nThe grand celebration was scheduled for Giovedi, the Italian word for Thursday, as the ponies believed it was the perfect day for a gathering. They decorated their party venue with the national flag of New Zealand, which featured four stars, to represent unity and friendship.\n\nDuring the party, Twilight Sparkle shared her newfound knowledge of scatology, the scientific study of feces. While it was an unusual topic, the ponies were fascinated by the information and appreciated the importance of understanding the natural world.\n\nThe highlight of the evening was a game of Bingo, where the ponies learned that the phrase \"Get up and run\" represented the number 31. They laughed and cheered as they played the game, enjoying the thrill of competition.\n\nFinally, the ponies shared the story of Roberto M. Ortiz, who became the President of Argentina in February 1938. They admired his leadership and dedication to his country, and the ponies felt inspired to be better leaders in their own community.\n\nThe My Little Pony friends had a magical and educational celebration, filled with laughter, love, and the joy of learning.

The riddles were left by an enigmatic villain who threatened to destroy the city's Manuel M. Torres Dam, the largest hydro plant in the country. The turtles knew they had to act fast to save their beloved city.\n\nThe first riddle led them to the meibomian gland, found in the human eye. Leonardo, the leader of the group, quickly deduced that the answer must be connected to a person with exceptional vision. They soon discovered that the person in question was Rebecca Adlington, a British swimmer who won Olympic Gold Medals in 2008 in the 400 and 800 m freestyle events.\n\nThe second riddle involved the NATO phonetic alphabet, specifically the word representing the letter I. Donatello, the tech-savvy turtle, quickly figured out that the word was \"India.\" This clue led them to a hidden library, where they found a book by US author Norman Mailer, titled 'The Naked and the Dead,' based on his military service in World War II.\n\nAs they continued their search, the turtles stumbled upon a clue about a Brooklyn-born author with parents named Malachy and Angela. Raphael, the tough and fearless turtle, recognized the author as Frank McCourt, who wrote the memoir 'Angela's Ashes.'\n\nThe next riddle mentioned a 1953 novel by Wolf Mankowitz, titled 'A Kid For Two\u2026' Michelangelo, the fun-loving and free-spirited turtle, excitedly completed the title: \"A Kid For Two Farthings!\"\n\nThe turtles were then led to a question about Britain's first Prime Minister. Leonardo, well-versed in history, identified the answer as Sir Robert Walpole. The following clue asked which bone connects the humerus with the clavicle in the human body. Donatello, with his vast knowledge of anatomy, answered that it was the scapula.\n\nFinally, the last riddle mentioned the first issue of a British children's comic published in April 1950. Raphael, a fan of comics, knew that the answer was \"The Eagle.\"\n\nWith all the riddles solved, the turtles discovered the location of the villain's hideout, deep within an abandoned warehouse near the dam. They swiftly defeated the villain, a disgruntled former engineer who sought revenge on the city for his dismissal. The turtles saved the Manuel M. Torres Dam from destruction, and the city was safe once again.\n\nAs the sun set over the New York skyline, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles returned to their lair, proud of their teamwork and intelligence. They knew that their unique skills and knowledge had once again saved the day, and they were ready for whatever challenges awaited them in the future."], "parsing_success_flag": [true],

They believed in the power of unity and harmony, symbolized by the two red stars on the national flag of Syria.\n\nAmong the competitors was a young duelist named Duane, who had a rare condition called Duane Syndrome, affecting his eyes. Despite his challenges, Duane was determined to prove his worth in the tournament. He was often taunted by his rivals, who called him \"Taphephobic Duane,\" as he had an abnormal fear of being buried alive, which they believed was a sign of weakness.\n\nAs the tournament progressed, Duane found himself facing a descendant of the French royal family, a distant relative of both Louis XV and Louis XIV. This aristocratic duelist was known for his strategic prowess and was considered a formidable opponent.\n\nIn preparation for the duel, Duane sought the guidance of the wise village druid from the comic strip 'Asterix,' who was rumored to have knowledge of powerful spells and potions. The druid, intrigued by Duane's determination, agreed to help him and brewed a potion that would enhance his focus and strategy during the duel.\n\nThe day of the duel arrived, and the entire kingdom was abuzz with excitement. The tournament was held in a grand arena located in the English county where former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was born \u2013 Lincolnshire.

John was fascinated by the history of his country and often visited the tomb of King John, which was located in an English cathedral.\n\nOne day, while exploring the cathedral, John discovered a hidden chamber containing a mysterious Beyblade. The Beyblade had a unique design, featuring a lupine emblem, relating to the wolf. Intrigued, John decided to learn more about this Beyblade and its origins.\n\nJohn's research led him to the 21st letter of the Greek alphabet, \"Phi,\" which was engraved on the Beyblade. He discovered that the Beyblade was created by a legendary blader who was inspired by the world's first major rock & roll concert, the Moondog Coronation Ball, held at the Cleveland Arena, Ohio, on 21st March 1952.\n\nAs John delved deeper into the Beyblade's history, he found a connection to the 1968 novel '2001: A Space Odyssey,' written by Arthur C. Clarke. The novel's themes of exploration and discovery resonated with the legendary blader, who believed that Beyblade battles could bring people together and promote understanding.\n\nJohn's journey took him to Scotland, where he met the Lord Advocate, the chief law officer of the country. The Lord Advocate shared stories of the legendary blader's battles during the reign of King Edward VIII, when Stanley Baldwin was the British Prime Minister.\n\nThe Lord Advocate also revealed that the legendary blader had a favorite flower, the 'Bellis perennis,' or the common daisy. This flower symbolized innocence and purity, which the blader believed were essential qualities for a true Beyblade champion.\n\nFinally, John learned that the legendary blader was inspired by the novel 'Seven Pillars of Wisdom,' written by T.E. Lawrence. The book's themes of unity and perseverance had guided the blader throughout his life, shaping his beliefs and his unique Beyblade.\n\nWith newfound knowledge and inspiration, John returned to Greece, determined to honor the legendary blader's legacy.

She decided to visit her friend, a camel with two humps named Bactria, to find a remedy for her condition.\n\nOn her way, Yona stopped at a local restaurant to try shashlik, a popular skewered meat dish. As she enjoyed her meal, she overheard a conversation about the history of women's rights. The speaker mentioned that psychoanalyst A.A. Brill had described cigarettes as \"Torches of Freedom\" in the 1920s, symbolizing equality for women.\n\nFeeling inspired, Yona continued her journey and stumbled upon a bookshop. She found a novel called \"Watership Down,\" which featured a character named Yona, just like her! This Yona was also a rabbit, and the story reminded her of her own adventures in Zootopia.\n\nAs Yona continued her journey, she passed by a television store where a show called \"Coronation Street\" was playing. She noticed that the factory boss, Danny Baldwin, was portrayed by actor Bradley Walsh. Intrigued, she made a mental note to watch the show later.\n\nYona finally arrived at Bactria's house, where they discussed the recent election of the British Conservative Party's new leader. They learned that in July 1965, Edward Heath had become the leader, sparking a new era in British politics.\n\nBactria, being knowledgeable about medicine, suggested that Yona's pyrosis might be due to ommatophobia, an irrational fear of eyes. Yona admitted that she had been feeling anxious about the eyes of the many creatures in Zootopia.\n\nAs they searched for a solution, they came across a novel by Charles Dickens, which featured a character named Inspector Bucket. They were inspired by his investigative skills and decided to use them to find a cure for Yona's condition.\n\nDuring their investigation, they discovered the story of Maria Dickin, the founder of the British animal charity called the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) in 1917. They were moved by her dedication to helping animals in need and decided to visit the local PDSA branch in Zootopia.\n\nAt the PDSA, Yona and Bactria found the help they needed. The kind veterinarians provided Yona with a treatment for her pyrosis and offered support for her ommatophobia.

One day, while exploring the town, Coco stumbled upon a mysterious record store. Intrigued, she entered and found a vinyl of Simon and Garfunkel's only UK number one hit single, \"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\" As the music played, Coco felt a sudden urge to embark on an adventure.\n\nCoco's first stop was the local library, where she discovered a delightful book of verses called \"Now We Are Six\" by A.A. Milne. The whimsical poems filled her with joy and inspired her to continue her journey.\n\nNext, Coco found herself at the town's cinema, where she watched the 1975 film \"Shampoo.\" She was fascinated by the character George Roundy, a Beverly Hills hairdresser played by Warren Beatty. Coco wondered if she could ever be as stylish as George.\n\nAs Coco continued her adventure, she stumbled upon a snooker club. She learned that there are 22 balls on a snooker table at the beginning of a game. Intrigued by the sport, Coco decided to try her paw at it, but quickly realized it was not her forte.\n\nFeeling a bit discouraged, Coco wandered into a betting shop.

Together, they navigated the vast ocean, guided by the stars and the London Underground rail system map, which Moana had found in a bottle. The map showed the District Line, the only line that interconnects with every other line, helping her understand the interconnectedness of all things.\n\nDuring their journey, Moana and Bullseye encountered a mysterious island where they met a sadistic military prison commandant named Colonel Winter, played by James Gandolfini. He was a character from the 2001 film starring Robert Redford, which had somehow come to life in this magical world. Moana bravely stood up to Colonel Winter and freed the prisoners he had captured.\n\nAs Moana continued her quest, she discovered a hidden cave filled with various animals. Among them, she found a female gerbil, which she learned was called a jill. Moana also met a friendly dragon named Idris, who reminded her of the dragon from the children's television series 'Ivor the Engine.'\n\nIn the cave, Moana stumbled upon a group of ferrets, which she learned was called a business. They were led by a wise old ferret who taught Moana the importance of teamwork and unity. With the help of her newfound friends, Moana continued her journey to save her people.\n\nAlong the way, Moana encountered Gentoo, Adelie, and Macaroni, three species of penguins who had been blown off course by a storm. They shared their knowledge of the ocean currents and helped Moana navigate her way through treacherous waters.\n\nAs Moana's journey progressed, she came across an island inhabited by fashion-conscious people who wore Straight Cut, Boot Cut, and Skinny jeans. They taught Moana the importance of self-expression and embracing one's unique style.\n\nFinally, Moana reached her destination and found the solution to save her people. As she returned home, she was greeted with a grand celebration. The villagers performed a stage musical, starring Phillip Schofield, Jason Donovan, and Donny Osmond, who had all played the lead role in the musical 'Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.'\n\nWith her courage, wisdom, and the help of her friends, Moana saved her people and brought prosperity to her island.

British comedian/presenter Clive, Scottish singer/musician Ian and English footballer Vivian all share which surname? What is the title of the 1976 film about the Watergate Scandal, starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman? What is the name of the Japanese sliding door or partition, made of a latticed screen covered with white paper? A rinkhals is what type of creature? During which year was Washington DC declared the capital of the USA?\n\nOnce upon a time in the world of Despicable Me, Gru was invited to give a motivational speech at Fenn Street School, the fictional school from the UK television series \"Please Sir.\" Gru was excited but nervous, as he had never spoken in front of a large audience before.\n\nOn his way to the school, Gru listened to Oasis, the British band that released their debut album \"Definitely Maybe\" in 1994, to pump himself up. As he arrived at the school, he noticed a poster of Tom Cruise from the 1996 film \"Jerry Maguire,\" where Cruise played a sports agent. This reminded Gru of his own career transformation from a supervillain to a secret agent.\n\nAs Gru began his speech, he referenced the nursery rhyme \"Sing a Song of Sixpence,\" where the Queen was in the parlor eating bread and honey. He used this to illustrate the importance of enjoying the simple pleasures in life. The audience was captivated by Gru's storytelling, including a tale about his encounter with Carson Wells, the bounty hunter played by Woody Harrelson in the 2007 film \"No Country for Old Men.\"\n\nGru also mentioned his friends Clive, Ian, and Vivian, who all shared the surname Anderson. They had recently watched the 1976 film \"All the President's Men\" together, which was about the Watergate Scandal and starred Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman. Gru emphasized the importance of learning from history and standing up for what is right.\n\nDuring the speech, Gru noticed a beautiful Japanese sliding door, or shoji, made of a latticed screen covered with white paper. He admired the craftsmanship and the way it allowed light to filter through. This inspired him to talk about the importance of letting light into one's life and being open to new experiences.\n\nAs Gru wrapped up his speech, he shared a story about his encounter with a rinkhals, a venomous snake native to Africa. He used this experience to emphasize the importance of facing one's fears and overcoming challenges.\n\nThe audience erupted in applause as Gru finished his speech. They were inspired by his words and the lessons he had learned throughout his life. As Gru left the stage, he felt a sense of accomplishment and pride, knowing that he had made a difference in the lives of the students at Fenn Street School.\n\nAs Gru returned home, he reflected on the history of Washington DC, which was declared the capital of the USA in 1790. He marveled at how much the world had changed since then and felt grateful for the opportunity to share his experiences and wisdom with others. And so, Gru continued his journey of personal growth and inspiring others, one speech at a time.\n---\nFeedback: The response is impressive in its incorporation of the answers to the 10 questions into a coherent story set in the Despicable Me universe. The information provided is accurate, and the story flows well, connecting the various elements in a creative and engaging manner. The story maintains the essence of the Despicable Me world while integrating the diverse topics from the questions.\n\nOne area that could be improved is the transition between some of the topics. For example, the mention of the Japanese sliding door (shoji) could be more seamlessly integrated into the story. Additionally, the ending could be strengthened by connecting it back to the Despicable Me universe or Gru's personal journey more explicitly.\n\nOverall, the response is well-executed and demonstrates a strong ability to weave together disparate pieces of information into a cohesive and entertaining story.\n---\nBased on your initial response and the subsequent feedback, revise the response.

Inspired by the athletes' dedication, Po remembered the motto \"Swifter, Higher, Stronger,\" which represents the modern Olympic Games.\n\nAs Po continued his journey, he encountered a peculiar scene from Greek mythology.

This reminded Po of the importance of understanding the consequences of one's actions.\n\nDuring his adventure, Po also celebrated St. Joseph's Day, which takes place in March. He enjoyed the festivities and learned about different cultures and traditions. Later, Po watched the 2001 film 'Angel Eyes,' where he admired the performance of Jennifer Lopez, who played Chicago police officer Sharon Pogue.\n\nIntrigued by the stories of Greek mythology, Po learned about Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods and gave it to the human race. This act of rebellion inspired Po to always stand up for what he believed in.\n\nFinally, Po came across a book that piqued his interest - the 1818 novel 'Frankenstein' by Mary Shelley. He was fascinated by the story of the monster's creator, Victor Frankenstein, and the consequences of playing with the forces of nature.\n\nThroughout his journey, Po gained wisdom and inspiration from various sources, which helped him become a better Kung Fu warrior and protector of the Valley of Peace."}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 415, "prompt_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 639}, "prompt": "Write a short and coherent story about Kung Fu Panda that incorporates the answers to the following 10 questions: Which band released a 1999 album entitled \u2018The Man Who\u2019?

One day, while watching the 1989 Ladies Singles Wimbledon Championship, he saw Steffi Graf win the title and was inspired by her determination and skill. He knew that if he worked hard, he could achieve his dreams too.\n\nRatatouille decided to start his culinary journey by watching classic films for inspiration. He stumbled upon \"Steamboat Willie,\" the debut of the iconic cartoon character Mickey Mouse, and was captivated by the creativity and innovation of the film.\n\nAs he continued to hone his skills, Ratatouille befriended a young hawk named Eyas. Eyas was an expert in finding the freshest ingredients for Ratatouille's culinary creations. Together, they made a great team, with Ratatouille's cooking skills and Eyas's keen eye for quality ingredients.\n\nOne day, while searching for ingredients, they came across a vintage American car with a logo featuring three shields inside a circle. It was a Buick, and inside the car, they found a cookbook that once belonged to Gisele B\u00fcndchen, the model declared \"Model of the Millennium\" by Vogue editor Anna Wintour.\n\nThe cookbook contained recipes that required them to learn new techniques and expand their culinary vocabulary. They discovered words like \"Catwalk,\" \"Boardwalk,\" and \"Jaywalk,\" which helped them navigate the busy streets of Paris. They also learned about \"Sidestep,\" \"Endstep,\" and \"Ability step,\" techniques that improved their agility in the kitchen.\n\nAs they continued to explore the cookbook, they found more words that inspired their culinary creations.

He navigated the bog with skill and determination, making use of the double-word score squares and channeling the strength of Black Beauty.\n\nIn the end, Olympus emerged victorious, proving that even a bug from the far reaches of the solar system could achieve greatness. His story was immortalized in a novel called \"The History Bug,\" written by Malcolm Bradbury, the author of the 1975 novel \"The History Man.\"\n\nAnd so, the legacy of Olympus and the World Bog Snorkelling Championships lived on, inspiring bugs everywhere to dream big and never give up.\n---\nFeedback: The response is creative and engaging, incorporating all the answers to the 10 questions into a coherent story. The information provided is accurate, and the story flows well, connecting the various elements in a fun and imaginative way. The story maintains a light-hearted tone and successfully integrates the diverse topics.\n\nOne minor critique is that the number of double-word score squares in a standard Scrabble board is actually 16, not 17.

She was known for her adventurous spirit and her love for nature. One day, as she was exploring the forest, she stumbled upon a mysterious car. It was the color of Lady Penelope's car from the television puppet series 'Thunderbirds' - a vibrant pink.\n\nCurious, Pocahontas decided to follow the car, which led her to a small store near a crossroads. The store was reminiscent of the first European retailer that began in Annecy, France in 1958. As she entered the store, she discovered a poster advertising a flying competition. The prize money for the fastest flight from London to Paris was the same as in the 1965 film 'Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines' - \u00a310,000.\n\nPocahontas was intrigued and decided to participate in the competition, hoping to use the prize money to help her tribe and learn more about the world. She sought the help of a famous director, who happened to be in the area scouting for locations for his next film. The director was none other than Ken Russell, who directed the 1969 film 'Women in Love', starring Oliver Reed and Glenda Jackson.\n\nTogether, they built a flying machine and set off on their journey. As they flew over Africa, they marveled at the sight of Mount Entoto, the highest peak overlooking the capital city of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. During their flight, they encountered a friendly skink, a type of reptile that decided to join them on their adventure.\n\nAs they continued their journey, they found themselves transported to the year 1997, the setting of the 1960's television series 'Lost in Space'. In this futuristic world, they met the Dalai Lama, who had just received a personalized Bradford City FC shirt with the number 12 on the back. The Dalai Lama shared his wisdom with Pocahontas and her friends, inspiring them to persevere in their quest.\n\nWith renewed determination, they continued their journey and encountered the children of a former US President - Michael, John, Steven, and Susan, who were the children of President Lyndon B. Johnson. The presidential siblings, impressed by Pocahontas' mission, decided to join her team and support her in the competition.\n\nWith the help of their new friends, Pocahontas and her team won the flying competition, and the prize money of \u00a310,000. They used the money to build a school in the Powhatan tribe, where children could learn about the world and its many wonders. And so, Pocahontas' adventurous spirit and love for nature continued to inspire generations to come."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 10}]}, "model": "gpt4-32k", "output_dir": "logs/self_refine", "model_type": "gpt", "method": "self_refine", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "_num_refine-1", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "num_refine": 1, "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["For how many years did English monarch King Henry III reign?", "What colour is Lady Penelope\u2019s car in the television puppet series \u2018Thunderbirds\u2019?", "Which chain of European retailers began with a store near a crossroads in Annecy, France in 1958?", "In the 1965 film \u2018Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines\u2019, how much is the prize money, in pounds sterling, for the fastest flight from London to Paris?", "Who directed the 1969 film \u2018Women in Love\u2019, starring Oliver Reed and Glenda Jackson?", "Mount Entoto is the highest peak overlooking which African capital city?", "A skink is what type of reptile?", "The 1960\u2019s television series \u2018Lost in Space\u2019 is set in which year?", "In 2012, Bradford City FC presented the Dalai Lama with a personalised club shirt with which number on the back?", "Michael, John, Steven and Susan are the children of which former US President?"], "answers": [["56", "fifty-six", "fifty six", "56"], ["Pink", "Pink the colour", "Momoiro", "Tamarisk (color)", "Neon pink", "Pastel pink", "FFD1DC", "Pinkest", "Lightish Red", "Pinkishness", "Light red", "Kinky pink", "Pinkness", "Tamarisk (colour)", "Pinkishly", "Pastel Pink", "FADADD", "Pink (color)", "Pinkly", "ffd1dc", "tamarisk colour", "pinkishly", "fadadd", "lightish red", "pinkly", "pinkishness", "kinky pink", "tamarisk color", "pink colour", "pinkest", "pastel pink", "pinkness", "neon pink", "pink color", "pink", "light red", "momoiro"], ["1Mobile", "Carrefour", "Carrefour Japan", "Carredour", "Carrefour Group", "Carrefour SA", "Carrefur", "Carrefour (company)", "Carefour", "Pryca", "Carrefour S.A.", "carrefour sa", "carrefour company", "carrefur", "1mobile", "carrefour", "carrefour japan", "carrefour group", "carredour", "carrefour s", "pryca", "carefour"], ["10,000", "10000", "ten thousand", "10000", "10 000", "ten thousand"], ["Henry Kenneth Russell", "Henry Kenneth Alfred Russell", "Henry Kenneth Alfred %22Ken%22 Russell", "Ken Russell", "Ken Russel", "henry kenneth russell", "henry kenneth alfred russell", "ken russel", "henry kenneth alfred 22ken 22 russell", "ken russell"], ["Ethiopian Natural History Museum", "Adis Abeba", "Addis Ababa, ET", "\u0100dd\u012bs \u0100beb\u0101", "\u0100d\u012bs \u0100beba", "Addis Abba, Ethiopia", "Addis Abba", "Tewodros Square", "Addis Abeba", "Addis Ababa Museum", "\u12a0\u12f2\u1235 \u12a0\u1260\u1263", "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia", "Capital of Ethiopia", "Ethiopian Ethnological Museum", "Addis Ababa", "Addis-Abeba", "New flower", "Addis Adaba", "Districts of Addis Ababa", "Adis Ababa", "The Grand Anwar Mosque (Addis Ababa)", "Adis abeda", "Finfinne", "adis abeba", "ethiopian natural history museum", "addis adaba", "grand anwar mosque addis ababa", "capital of ethiopia", "ethiopian ethnological museum", "addis ababa ethiopia", "districts of addis ababa", "\u12a0\u12f2\u1235 \u12a0\u1260\u1263", "addis ababa", "\u0101d\u012bs \u0101beba", "addis abba ethiopia", "adis abeda", "\u0101dd\u012bs \u0101beb\u0101", "addis abba", "addis ababa et", "finfinne", "tewodros square", "addis ababa museum", "new flower", "addis abeba", "adis ababa"], ["Lacertilian", "Lizards in captivity", "Lizards", "Lacertians", "Spotted lizard", "Lacertia", "Lacertilia", "Lizard", "Lacertian", "List of Lizards", "Lacertids", "Chipkali", "lacertilian", "lacertians", "lacertia", "lacertilia", "lacertids", "chipkali", "lizard", "lizards in captivity", "list of lizards", "spotted lizard", "lizards", "lacertian"], ["one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven", "1997", "one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven", "1997"], ["fourteen", "14", "fourteen", "14"], ["President Gerald R.
