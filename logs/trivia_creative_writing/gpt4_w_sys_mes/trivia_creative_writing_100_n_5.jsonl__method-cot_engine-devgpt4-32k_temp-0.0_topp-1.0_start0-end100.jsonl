The town was buzzing with excitement as the famous director John Ford was in town to shoot his latest film, \"Stagecoach.\" Pikachu, being a fan of westerns, couldn't wait to see the action unfold.\n\nAs Pikachu approached the set, it noticed a group of musicians playing a catchy tune. The band was none other than Pink Floyd, with Dave Gilmore and Roger Waters leading the performance. They were in town to provide the soundtrack for the film, and their music filled the air with a sense of adventure. Pikachu couldn't help but dance along to the rhythm.\n\nAfter the performance, Pikachu decided to explore the town further and found itself on a long stretch of road. A sign nearby read \"Highway 61,\" the very same highway that inspired Bob Dylan's classic 60s album \"Highway 61 Revisited.\" Pikachu felt a sense of nostalgia as it walked down the historic road.\n\nAs Pikachu continued its journey, it stumbled upon a group of athletes training for the upcoming 1984 LA Olympics. Among them was a gymnast from Romania, the only Eastern Bloc country to participate in the games. Pikachu was amazed by the gymnast's grace and skill and decided to learn a few moves itself.\n\nOne evening, as Pikachu practiced its newfound gymnastics skills, it overheard a conversation about a 90s sci-fi series called \"Wild Palms.\" The show, starring James Belushi, was based on Bruce Wagner's comic strip of the same name. Intrigued, Pikachu decided to find a way to watch the series.\n\nAs the sun set on the small western town, Pikachu felt a sense of accomplishment. It had experienced the magic of cinema, danced to the tunes of Pink Floyd, walked down the historic Highway 61, learned gymnastics from an Olympic athlete, and discovered a new sci-fi series to enjoy. With a heart full of adventure, Pikachu continued its journey, eager to see what other surprises the world had in store."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Who directed the classic 30s western Stagecoach?", "Dave Gilmore and Roger Waters were in which rock group?", "Which highway was Revisited in a classic 60s album by Bob Dylan?", "Which was the only eastern bloc country to participate in the 1984 LA Olympics?", "Which 90s sci fi series with James Belushi was based on Bruce Wagner's comic strip of the same name?"], "answers": [["John Ford (1895-1973)", "Sean O'Feeney", "John Ford (film director)", "Ford, John (1895-1973)", "Argosy Pictures", "John Ford statue", "John Martin O'Feeney", "John Ford (director)", "Cavalry trilogy", "John O'Feeney", "Sean Aloysius O'Feeney", "Ford, John", "John Ford", "john ford 1895 1973", "sean o feeney", "ford john 1895 1973", "john ford statue", "ford john", "john o feeney", "john ford", "sean aloysius o feeney", "argosy pictures", "cavalry trilogy", "john ford film director", "john ford director", "john martin o feeney"], ["Grey Floyd", "Pink Floyd trivia", "The Screaming Ab Dabs", "Pink flowd", "The Meggadeaths", "The Architectural Abdabs", "PINK FLOYD", "Pink Flod", "Pink Floyd", "Pink Floyd Trivia", "The Pink Floyd", "Notable or frequent contributors to pink floyd", "The Tea Set", "Pinkfloyd", "Pi5", "Pink floid", "Pink Floyd (band)", "The T Set", "Screaming abdabs", "Notable or frequent contributors to Pink Floyd", "The Megadeaths", "Pik floyd", "The Pink Floyd Sound", "Pink floyd", "The T-Set", "The Screaming Abdabs", "Clive Metcalfe", "Meggadeaths", "screaming abdabs", "megadeaths", "clive metcalfe", "pink floyd band", "pink flowd", "meggadeaths", "pi5", "pink floyd", "screaming ab dabs", "grey floyd", "architectural abdabs", "pink flod", "pinkfloyd", "pik floyd", "pink floyd sound", "tea set", "pink floid", "t set", "pink floyd trivia", "notable or frequent contributors to pink floyd"], ["61", "sixty-one", "61", "sixty one"], ["ISO 3166-1:RO", "Romanian state", "ROMANIA", "Roumania", "Etymology of Romania", "Romainia", "Rom\u00eenia", "North Danubian region", "Carpathian Danubian space", "ROU", "Rom\u00e2nia", "Romanian State", "Roumanie", "Country ROM", "Rromania", "Romania", "Republic of Romania", "RO (country)", "Rum\u00e4nien", "Danubian-Carpathian Area", "Rumania", "Austro-Hungarian Empire (Romania)", "Rumunia", "danubian carpathian area", "roumania", "austro hungarian empire romania", "romania", "rromania", "iso 3166 1 ro", "rou", "country rom", "ro country", "rumunia", "romainia", "rum\u00e4nien", "etymology of romania", "north danubian region", "rom\u00eenia", "rumania", "romanian state", "carpathian danubian space", "rom\u00e2nia", "republic of romania", "roumanie"], ["Wild Palms", "wild palms"]], "question_ids": ["tc_280", "tc_282", "tc_288", "tc_298", "tc_304"], "topic": "Pikachu"}}

Lorax was on a quest to find answers to five mysterious questions that had been puzzling him for years. He knew that finding these answers would bring him great wisdom and understanding.\n\nOne day, Lorax met a wise old owl perched on a tree. The owl, sensing Lorax's curiosity, asked him what he sought. Lorax shared the first question: \"Who became Israel's head of state in 1993?\" The owl, with a twinkle in its eye, replied, \"Ah, that would be Yitzhak Rabin.\"\n\nFeeling grateful and encouraged, Lorax continued his journey and soon encountered a historian who was studying the events of World War II. Lorax asked the historian his second question: \"In WWII, who was the head of the Nazi party's security service?\" The historian thought for a moment and then answered, \"That would be Heinrich Himmler.\"\n\nAs Lorax ventured further, he stumbled upon a map that showed the states along the Gulf of Mexico. He carefully examined the map to find the answer to his third question: \"Which state on the Gulf of Mexico is nearest the end of the alphabet?\" After a moment, he realized the answer was Texas.\n\nLorax's journey then led him to a small airport where he met a friendly pilot. He asked the pilot his fourth question: \"Truax Field International Airport is in which US state?\" The pilot, with a smile, responded, \"That airport is located in the beautiful state of Wisconsin.\"\n\nFinally, Lorax found himself in a library where he discovered a book about the 1904 Olympics. He eagerly flipped through the pages to find the answer to his fifth and final question: \"In the 1904 Olympics, how many of the 23 track and field titles were won by Americans?\" To his delight, he found that Americans had won 21 of the 23 titles.\n\nWith all five questions answered, Lorax felt a sense of accomplishment and wisdom.

Lorax was on a quest to find answers to five mysterious questions that had been puzzling him for years. He knew that finding these answers would bring him great wisdom and understanding.\n\nOne day, Lorax met a wise old owl perched on a tree. The owl, sensing Lorax's curiosity, asked him what he sought. Lorax shared the first question: \"Who became Israel's head of state in 1993?\" The owl, with a twinkle in its eye, replied, \"Ah, that would be Yitzhak Rabin.\"\n\nFeeling grateful and encouraged, Lorax continued his journey and soon encountered a historian who was studying the events of World War II. Lorax asked the historian his second question: \"In WWII, who was the head of the Nazi party's security service?\" The historian thought for a moment and then answered, \"That would be Heinrich Himmler.\"\n\nAs Lorax ventured further, he stumbled upon a map that showed the states along the Gulf of Mexico. He carefully examined the map to find the answer to his third question: \"Which state on the Gulf of Mexico is nearest the end of the alphabet?\" After a moment, he realized the answer was Texas.\n\nLorax's journey then led him to a small airport where he met a friendly pilot. He asked the pilot his fourth question: \"Truax Field International Airport is in which US state?\" The pilot, with a smile, responded, \"That airport is located in the beautiful state of Wisconsin.\"\n\nFinally, Lorax found himself in a library where he discovered a book about the 1904 Olympics. He eagerly flipped through the pages to find the answer to his fifth and final question: \"In the 1904 Olympics, how many of the 23 track and field titles were won by Americans?\" To his delight, he found that Americans had won 21 of the 23 titles.\n\nWith all five questions answered, Lorax felt a sense of accomplishment and wisdom. He returned to his home, eager to share the knowledge he had gained with others.

One day, while his owners were away, Henry stumbled upon a book about the history of humans. He became fascinated by the stories of kings and queens, particularly the tale of Henry VIII and his many wives.\n\nAs he read, Henry learned that Catherine Parr, the sixth wife of Henry VIII, had already married twice before she became queen and married for a fourth time after Henry's death. This fact intrigued Henry, and he couldn't help but wonder what life was like for Catherine and the other wives.\n\nHenry's curiosity didn't stop there. He soon discovered the Habsburg Castle in Switzerland, which gave the Habsburg dynasty its name.

Among them was Ovy, a unique emoji who represented the hormone that controlled ovulation. Ovy was on a mission to save her world from an impending disaster.\n\nOne day, Ovy met Argon, the second most common gas in the atmosphere. Argon was a wise and knowledgeable emoji who offered to help Ovy on her journey. Together, they discovered that their world was facing a serious problem: the nutrient enrichment of lakes, known as eutrophication. This phenomenon was causing the lakes in their world to become polluted and uninhabitable for many emojis.\n\nAs they investigated further, Ovy and Argon learned about the five-legged creatures that had damaged a 1250-mile-long wonder of the world, known as the Emoji Wall. These creatures were responsible for the eutrophication, and Ovy and Argon knew they had to stop them to save their world.\n\nWith determination and teamwork, Ovy and Argon embarked on a quest to defeat the five-legged creatures. They traveled approximately 24,901 miles, which is the circumference of the Earth, to gather allies and resources for their battle.\n\nFinally, Ovy and Argon confronted the five-legged creatures and, using their combined knowledge and strength, defeated them. The Emoji Wall was restored, and the lakes in their world were no longer polluted.

During one exciting match, he learned about a term called \"let,\" which is given to a point in tennis that has to be replayed. This new knowledge made him even more interested in the sport.\n\nThe Iron Giant was particularly inspired by Fred Perry, the last English-born player to win the men's singles title at Wimbledon.

Unbeknownst to them, they shared a deep love for music and a mysterious family history. Their paths crossed at a Beatles tribute concert, where they were both drawn to the album cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. As they marveled at the trumpet held by Paul McCartney, they couldn't help but notice their striking resemblance to one another.\n\nAs the concert continued, the song \"Sunny Afternoon\" by The Kinks began to play, with the opening line, \"The taxman's taken all my dough.\" This song struck a chord with both Lucy and Lily, as they sang along and felt an inexplicable connection. They decided to spend more time together, and soon discovered that they were, in fact, long-lost twins.\n\nAs they delved into their family history, they learned about their great-uncle George Cornell, who was murdered by the infamous Kray twins in 1966.

The event was a huge success, with a special screening of \"The Seven Year Itch,\" directed by Billy Wilder and starring Marilyn Monroe.

The Minions were captivated by the story of a father working with his estranged daughter to rescue her kidnapped child.\n\nOne of the Minions, Kevin, was particularly fond of the 1988 film, \"The Accused.\" He admired the powerful performance of Jodie Foster, who won the Best Actress Oscar for her role in the movie. Kevin would often reenact scenes from the film, much to the amusement of his fellow Minions.\n\nDuring a trip to London, the Minions decided to explore the city's hidden treasures. They learned about a river that flowed underground, rising in Hampstead and passing through St. Pancras, down Farringdon Street, and entering the Thames by Blackfriars Bridge. This river, known as the River Fleet, intrigued the Minions, and they spent hours exploring its mysterious depths.\n\nAs their London adventure came to an end, the Minions decided to watch one last movie together. They chose the 1979 film \"The First Great Train Robbery,\" starring Sean Connery. As they watched, they noticed a dancer with a notable cameo, Wayne Sleep, breaking into a guarded station office. The Minions were delighted to recognize the dancer and marveled at his impressive skills.\n\nThe Minions' love for classic movies and actors brought them closer together and enriched their lives with the magic of cinema.

Every time she was mentioned, Beauty couldn't help but think of a hippopotamus, as Reggie Perrin had once described his own mother-in-law.\n\nOne winter, the village was preparing for a grand Christmas celebration. To everyone's surprise, the former prime minister, Harold Wilson, who had appeared on the Morecambe and Wise Christmas Special in 1978, decided to visit the village and join the festivities. The entire village buzzed with excitement, and Beauty and the Beast were no exception.\n\nAs part of the celebrations, the couple decided to take a trip to Kitzb\u00fchel, Austria, where the infamous \"Streif\" downhill ski race took place. They marveled at the breathtaking views and the daring skiers who braved the treacherous slopes. The trip brought them even closer together, and they enjoyed every moment of their adventure.\n\nOne evening, as they sat by the fireplace in their cozy Austrian cabin, Beauty and the Beast decided to sing a duet. They chose the song \"Baby, It's Cold Outside,\" which had been a hit for Tom Jones and Cerys Matthews in 1999. Their voices blended beautifully, and they laughed and sang, enjoying each other's company.\n\nAs the trip came to an end, the Beast presented Beauty with a special gift. It was a delicate piece of jewelry made from lithium, the lightest metal under standard conditions. Beauty was touched by the thoughtfulness of the gift and the symbolism it held - their love was strong, yet light and free.\n\nAnd so, Beauty and the Beast returned to their village, their love stronger than ever.

There, he encountered Jareth the Goblin King, played by the legendary British singer David Bowie. Jareth, intrigued by Link's courage and determination, decided to aid him in his quest by providing valuable information about Ganondorf's whereabouts.\n\nInspired by the story of South African civil rights leader Steve Biko, whose life was depicted in the 1987 film 'Cry Freedom,' Link vowed to fight for the freedom of all the inhabitants of Hyrule, not just Princess Zelda.\n\nIn his travels, Link also met a brave and resourceful woman named Valerie, played by British actress Kathy Burke. Valerie had once been a captive of Ganondorf but managed to escape his clutches. She joined Link on his quest, providing valuable insight and assistance in their battles against the forces of evil.\n\nOne of the most remarkable characters Link encountered was a skilled archer named Maria, who hailed from a distant land. Maria's prowess with a bow was legendary, and she had won the Women's Singles Finals at Wimbledon in 1959, 1960, and 1964, a feat accomplished by the Brazilian player Maria Bueno. Maria's incredible skill and determination inspired Link and his companions to push forward in their quest to save Hyrule.\n\nTogether, Link, Valerie, Maria, and their allies fought valiantly against Ganondorf and his minions, ultimately rescuing Princess Zelda and restoring peace to the kingdom. The Legend of Zelda would be remembered for generations to come, a testament to the power of courage, friendship, and the indomitable human spirit."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 5, "question_count": 5}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "cot", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_5.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Which British monarch famously said \u2018I don\u2019t wish to open windows into men\u2019s souls\u2019?", "Which British singer played Jareth the Goblin King in the 1986 film \u2018Labyrinth\u2019?", "The 1987 film \u2018Cry Freedom\u2019 is a biographical drama about which South African civil rights leader?", "Which British actress played Valerie in the 1997 film \u2018Nil By Mouth\u2019?", "What was the name of the Brazilian player who won the Women\u2019s Singles Finals at Wimbledon in 1959, 1960 and 1964?"], "answers": [["The Gloriana", "Queen Elisabeth of england", "Elizabeth the First", "Queene Elisabeth of England", "Bess of England", "Elizabeth I of Ireland", "Queen Elizabeth 1", "Queen Elisabeth I", "Elizabeth I (England)", "Elizabeth I of Great Britain", "Queen of England Elizabeth", "Queen Elizabeth the first", "Queen Elizabeth I of England", "Elizabeth the first", "Elizabeth I of the United Kingdom", "Queen of England Elizabeth I", "QEI", "Elizabeth I", "Queen Elizabeth of England", "Elisabeth 1st", "La Vita della Regina Elizabetta", "Elisabeth I of England", "Elisabeth of England", "Queen Elizabeth the First", "Elizabeth I of England", "Good Queen Bess", "Liz 1", "Virgin Queen", "Elizabeth 1", "Queen Elizabeth l", "Elizabeth of England", "Elizabeth I Tudor", "Elizabeth Tudor", "Elizabeth I, Queen of England", "Elizabeth the 1st", "Queen Elizabeth I", "Elizabeth i of england", "Elisabeth I", "elizabeth first", "elizabeth i of ireland", "elizabeth tudor", "queen elizabeth 1", "elizabeth i", "queen of england elizabeth i", "queen elizabeth i of england", "la vita della regina elizabetta", "good queen bess", "queen elisabeth of england", "elisabeth i", "elisabeth i of england", "elizabeth i england", "elizabeth i of england", "bess of england", "elizabeth of england", "queen elizabeth l", "elisabeth 1st", "elizabeth 1st", "qei", "queen elizabeth of england", "elizabeth 1", "elizabeth i of great britain", "queen of england elizabeth", "queene elisabeth of england", "queen elizabeth i", "elisabeth of england", "gloriana", "elizabeth i of united kingdom", "queen elisabeth i", "queen elizabeth first", "elizabeth i tudor", "virgin queen", "elizabeth i queen of england", "liz 1"], ["Hermione Farthingale", "Ziggy Stardust (persona)", "The Berlin Trilogy", "Berlin Trilogy", "Bowiesque", "David Bowie", "David bowie filmography", "Davie Jones and the King Bees", "Bowiean", "David bowie", "Tao Jones Index", "Bowie, David", "The Konrads", "Davie Jones with the King Bees", "David Bowie's", "David Bowi", "Davis bowie", "The Manish Boys", "David Robert Hayward-Jones", "Ziggy stardust (persona)", "The King of Glitter Rock", "David Hayward-Jones", "The Lower Third", "Davy Jones and the Lower Third", "tao jones index", "bowie david", "konrads", "davis bowie", "king of glitter rock", "david robert hayward jones", "berlin trilogy", "david bowi", "davy jones and lower third", "david bowie filmography", "davie jones and king bees", "ziggy stardust persona", "bowiesque", "manish boys", "david hayward jones", "hermione farthingale", "david bowie s", "david bowie", "bowiean", "davie jones with king bees", "lower third"], ["Steve Biko", "Steve Bantu Biko", "Bantu Steven Biko", "Steven Biko", "Stephen Bantu Biko", "Stephen Biko", "Gerhardus Hattingh", "steven biko", "gerhardus hattingh", "steve bantu biko", "stephen bantu biko", "stephen biko", "bantu steven biko", "steve biko"], ["Kathy Burke", "Katherine Lucy Bridget Burke", "Cathy Burke", "cathy burke", "kathy burke", "katherine lucy bridget burke"], ["Maria Ester Bueno", "Maria Esther Bueno", "Maria Ester Audion Bueno", "Maria Esther Andion Bueno", "Maria Bueno", "Bueno, Maria Esther Andion", "maria bueno", "maria esther bueno", "maria ester audion bueno", "maria ester bueno", "bueno maria esther andion", "maria esther andion bueno"]], "question_ids": ["qb_345", "qb_355", "qb_370", "qb_382", "qb_388"], "topic": "Legend of Zelda"}}
