Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance!

Here's my initial attempt at the story:\n\nOnce upon a time in the state of Virginia, a young lion named Simba was born. He was named after Gene Vincent, a famous musician from the same state. As Simba grew older, he became fascinated with the world of movies and music.\n\nOne day, Simba stumbled upon a movie set where they were filming \"The Crow.\" He learned about the tragic death of Brandon Lee during the making of the film and felt a deep sense of sadness. To cheer himself up, Simba decided to explore the world of music.\n\nHe discovered a catchy song called \"Let's Do It Again\" by The Staple Singers and couldn't stop humming the tune. Inspired by their success, Simba decided to attend MC Hammer's \"Too Legit To Quit\" tour, where he learned about the importance of perseverance and hard work.\n\nSimba then came across a poem by Rudyard Kipling, which taught him to treat Triumph and Disaster as \"two imposters\" and to face them with the same attitude. This lesson helped Simba become a wise and humble lion.\n\nOne day, Simba met Elton John, the most successful UK solo artist in the USA. They became friends, and Elton John taught Simba about the world of music and fame. During their travels, they flew on an airline called TAAG, which came from Angola.\n\nSimba's favorite song became \"Upside Down\" by Diana Ross, and he would often sing it to himself while exploring new places. He also learned about the tragic death of River Phoenix during the making of \"Dark Blood\" and realized the importance of living life to the fullest.\n\nAs Simba continued his journey, he met Mel Gibson, who shared his middle name, Columcille, with the young lion.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words.

Here's my initial attempt at the story:\n\nIn the bustling city of Metropolis, Superman was on a mission to save the day. He had received a mysterious letter containing ten clues, each leading to a person or event that needed his help. The first clue led him to a movie set where Warren Beatty was filming his first movie, \"Splendor in the Grass.\" Superman swooped in just in time to prevent a lighting rig from falling on the young actor.\n\nNext, he found himself on the set of \"Wonder Woman,\" where he met Debra Winger, who was playing Wonder Girl. Together, they stopped a villain who was trying to sabotage the show. Afterward, Superman received a call from his friend Micky Dolenz, formerly known as Mickey Braddock from the \"Circus Boy\" series. Micky's band, The Monkees, was in town for a concert, and their equipment had been stolen. Superman quickly recovered the instruments, and the show went on.\n\nWhile flying over the city, Superman spotted Mike Connors, a war veteran and former Director of News & Special Events for ABC, who was now playing a TV cop. Mike was in trouble, as he had stumbled upon a real-life crime scene. Superman arrived just in time to apprehend the criminals and save Mike.\n\nLater, Superman found himself in a living room where a family was watching \"I Love Lucy,\" the first US sitcom exported to Britain. He noticed that their television was about to explode and quickly replaced it with a new one, saving the family from harm.\n\nSuperman then received a message from his friend Pete Sampras, who was playing against Tim Henman in the Wimbledon singles semifinal. A rogue tennis ball machine was firing balls at dangerous speeds, putting the players and spectators at risk. Superman flew to Wimbledon and stopped the machine, allowing the match to continue safely.\n\nAfterward, Superman attended a family gathering of Olympic athletes Flo Jo and Jackie Joyner Kersee, who were sisters-in-law. He helped them resolve a dispute and reminded them of the importance of family and sportsmanship.\n\nNext, Superman encountered swimmer Michelle Smith-de Bruin, who had been banned for attempting to manipulate a drug test. He spoke to her about the importance of honesty and integrity in sports and encouraged her to learn from her mistakes.\n\nSuperman's penultimate stop was in China, where he discovered swimmer Yuan Yuan carrying drugs for the Chinese swim team. He intervened and ensured that the drugs were confiscated, promoting fair play in sports.\n\nFinally, Superman met with Pete Sampras once more, who was reflecting on his career and the one grand slam he hadn't won in the 20th century: the French Open. Superman reminded Pete of his incredible achievements and encouraged him to keep striving for greatness.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\n\nIn the bustling city of Metropolis, Superman was on a mission to save the day.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance!

Here's my initial attempt:\n\nIn the bustling city of New York, Wonder Woman was on a mission to protect the world from an evil villain who threatened to flood the internet with Spam, causing chaos and confusion. As she flew over the city, she passed by the prestigious Juilliard School, founded in 1905, where talented musicians honed their skills.\n\nDuring her pursuit, Wonder Woman encountered the spirit of Gert Fredriksson, the legendary kayaker who won six Olympic gold medals. He offered her advice on perseverance and determination, reminding her of Mike Hawthorn, the Formula One champion who won 3 of his 45 races.\n\nAs she continued her quest, Wonder Woman discovered a hidden library containing a copy of the once-banned book, My Life and Loves by Frank Harris. She was inspired by the courage of the author to share his story despite the controversy.\n\nIn her battle against the villain, Wonder Woman sought the help of powerful allies. She teamed up with Anne Bancroft, the talented actress born in the 1930s, and Blondie, the iconic band whose last UK No 1 of the 80s was \"The Tide Is High.\"\n\nTogether, they devised a plan to defeat the villain at a charity event featuring an auction of Princess Diana's dresses. The most expensive dress, designed by Victor Edelstein, would serve as a decoy to lure the villain into a trap.\n\nAs the final battle approached, Wonder Woman received a gift from her friend, supermodel Cindy Crawford. It was a custom-made outfit inspired by the rock star Elvis Presley, after whom Cindy had named her first son.\n\nWith the combined strength of her allies and the wisdom of the past, Wonder Woman defeated the villain and saved the world from the threat of Spam. The people celebrated their victory, and the legacy of Yasser Arafat, the co-founder of al Fatah, lived on as a symbol of resilience and hope.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\n\nIn the bustling city of New York, Wonder Woman was on a mission to protect the world from an evil villain who threatened to flood the internet with Spam, causing chaos and confusion.

She often swam to the surface to watch the humans and their activities. One day, she saw a ship carrying a famous actor named Charlie Chaplin, who was one of the founders of United Artists. The ship was heading to a beautiful coastal town called Maastricht, known for its historic treaty that symbolized closer economic links between European countries.\n\nThe Little Mermaid followed the ship and discovered a vibrant city with a famous nightclub called La Cage Aux Folles. The city covered only 6.8% of the Earth's surface, but it was full of life and excitement. She also learned about the city of Reims, the home of champagne, where the German High Command had surrendered in World War II.\n\nAs she explored the city, the Little Mermaid came across an underground railway system, the first of its kind in Europe, built in London. She was amazed by the ingenuity of humans and their ability to create such marvelous inventions. One day, she stumbled upon a drawing of Mickey Mouse, created by a talented artist named Ub Iwerks, who worked closely with Disney.\n\nThe Little Mermaid became friends with a kind-hearted actress named Julie Andrews, who had written a novel called \"The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles.\" Julie told her about a film called \"Harper Valley PTA,\" starring Barbara Eden, which was based on a record by Jeannie C. Riley.\n\nInspired by the stories and the world above the sea, the Little Mermaid decided to embark on her own adventure, hoping to learn more about the fascinating human world and the wonders it held."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "spp_profile", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In which country was Earl Spencer's acrimonious divorce settlement heard?", "Which of the founders of United Artists had the last name nearest the beginning of the alphabet?", "In La Cage Aux Folles, what was La Cage Aux Folles?", "What percentage of the earth's surface is covered by Europe?", "Which European town gave its name to a Treaty which symbolizes closer economic links between European countries?", "Which home of champagne in France was also where the German High Command surrendered in WWII?", "Which was the first European city this century to open an underground railway system?", "Who first drew Mickey Mouse when ?Disney first supplied the voice?", "Which actress wrote the novel The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles?", "Who was the star of the film based on the record Harper Valley PTA by Jeannie C Riley?"], "answers": [["South africa", "South Africa's", "Southafrica", "Third Republic (South Africa)", "Republiek van Suid-Afrika", "Sou'frica", "Zuid Afrika", "Zuid-Afrika", "ISO 3166-1:ZA", "South-African", "S Africa", "Zuid Africa", "Mzansi", "Afrique du sud", "Zuidafrika", "Ningizimu Afrika", "Capital of South Africa", "Suid-Afrika", "South-Africa", "Rep. of SOUTH AFRICA", "The Republic of South Africa", "Suid Africa", "Azania/South Africa", "S Afr", "Saffa", "South African", "Seth efrika", "South Africa", "Soufrica", "Republic of south africa", "South Africa\u00e0", "The Beloved Country", "S.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

Here's my initial attempt at the story:\n\nIn the city of Municiberg, the Incredibles family was invited to a science exhibition. As they entered the exhibition, they saw a giant glass sculpture made from sand. Violet, the curious one, asked her father, Mr. Incredible, about evaporation, the process of liquid turning into gas. He explained it to her using a nearby water exhibit as an example.\n\nDash, always eager to learn, asked his mother, Elastigirl, about the branch of science that involves addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. She smiled and told him it was mathematics. As they continued exploring, they encountered an ostrich, the fastest animal on two legs, which reminded Dash of his own super-speed.\n\nThe family then came across a section dedicated to the plant kingdom. They learned about mosses, which belong to the Bryophyta division, and hydrophytes, plants that grow in water or water-logged conditions.

As they continued their journey, they came across a lake that was experiencing eutrophication, causing an explosion of algae growth.\n\nNemo and his friends decided to investigate the cause of this phenomenon. They discovered that the culprit was a group of starfish that had damaged the Great Barrier Reef, a 1250-mile long wonder of the world. The starfish had released a substance similar to progesterone, a hormone that helps control ovulation, which had caused the nutrient enrichment of the lake.\n\nTo save the lake, Nemo and his friends needed to find a way to neutralize the effects of the starfish. They sought the help of a wise old turtle who lived near the lake. The turtle told them about a mineral called gypsum, which could be used to create a barrier that would prevent the starfish from releasing the harmful substance into the lake.\n\nWith the guidance of the turtle, Nemo and his friends traveled around the earth, whose circumference was approximately 24,901 miles, in search of gypsum. Along the way, they encountered a mysterious light that was as bright as 23 Suns. The light was emitted by the star Sirius, which was orbited by the Pup.\n\nThe light from Sirius illuminated their path, revealing the three primary colors of light: red, green, and blue. As they continued their journey, they discovered a helium-filled balloon that had been released by a child on the other side of the world. The balloon carried a message with the value of Pi to three decimal places: 3.142.\n\nInspired by the message, Nemo and his friends used the knowledge of Pi to calculate the exact amount of gypsum needed to create the barrier. They successfully neutralized the effects of the starfish, restoring the lake to its natural state and saving the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nIn the vast ocean, Nemo and his friends embarked on a new adventure.

They swam through a region where the water was rich in oxygen, making it easier for them to breathe. As they continued their journey, they came across a lake that was experiencing eutrophication, causing an explosion of algae growth.\n\nNemo and his friends decided to investigate the cause of this phenomenon. They discovered that the culprit was a group of starfish that had damaged the Great Barrier Reef, a 1250-mile long wonder of the world. The starfish had released a substance similar to progesterone, a hormone that helps control ovulation, which had caused the nutrient enrichment of the lake.\n\nTo save the lake, Nemo and his friends needed to find a way to neutralize the effects of the starfish. They sought the help of a wise old turtle who lived near the lake. The turtle told them about a mineral called gypsum, which could be used to create a barrier that would prevent the starfish from releasing the harmful substance into the lake.\n\nWith the guidance of the turtle, Nemo and his friends traveled around the earth, whose circumference was approximately 24,901 miles, in search of gypsum. Along the way, they encountered a mysterious light that was as bright as 23 Suns. The light was emitted by the star Sirius, which was orbited by the Pup.\n\nThe light from Sirius illuminated their path, revealing the three primary colors of light: red, green, and blue. As they continued their journey, they discovered a helium-filled balloon that had been released by a child on the other side of the world. The balloon carried a message with the value of Pi to three decimal places: 3.142.\n\nInspired by the message, Nemo and his friends used the knowledge of Pi to calculate the exact amount of gypsum needed to create the barrier. They successfully neutralized the effects of the starfish, restoring the lake to its natural state and saving the Great Barrier Reef."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos":

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer.

The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance!

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements.

To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Here's my initial attempt at the story:\n\nOnce upon a time in the Jungle Book, Mowgli and his animal friends decided to organize a trivia night to test their knowledge. They invited a wise old owl named Ritchie Valens to host the event. As the sun set, the animals gathered around a large tree, eager to participate.\n\nThe first question Ritchie asked was about the different types of bats that lived in the jungle. Mowgli knew that fruit, cricket, and horseshoe were all varieties of bats, and he shared this information with his friends. Baloo, the bear, was particularly fascinated by the cricket bats, as he loved playing cricket with Mowgli.\n\nNext, Ritchie asked about a famous poet to whom a postman named Il Postino delivered mail. Bagheera, the wise panther, knew the answer was Pablo Neruda. He shared a beautiful poem by Neruda that spoke of the wonders of nature, which resonated with all the animals in the jungle.\n\nAs the trivia night continued, Ritchie asked about a nickname given to a premiership footballer named Neil Ruddock. Kaa, the snake, slithered up and whispered the answer, \"Razor,\" into Mowgli's ear. Mowgli was amazed by Kaa's knowledge of human sports.\n\nThe next question was about a stand-up comedian who presented shows called \"8 Out Of 10 Cats\" and \"Distraction.\" King Louie, the orangutan, swung from a vine and proudly announced the answer: Jimmy Carr. He then proceeded to tell a few jokes, making everyone laugh.\n\nRitchie then asked about a game show where contestants were set physical and mental challenges, presented by Leslie Grantham and Melinda Messenger. Shere Khan, the tiger, growled the answer, \"Fort Boyard.\" He explained that he had once stumbled upon a human village where he saw the show on television.\n\nThe wise owl continued with a question about the presenter of Family Fortunes between Bob Monkhouse and Les Dennis. Hathi, the elephant, trumpeted the answer: Max Bygraves. He remembered hearing the name from a group of travelers who had passed through the jungle.\n\nRitchie's next question was about the reason for which Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics. Mowgli, having learned about the great scientist from his human friends, knew the answer was the photoelectric effect. The animals marveled at the brilliance of human minds.\n\nThe penultimate question was about a planet with moons named after Shakespearean characters. Akela, the wolf, howled the answer: Uranus. He shared stories of the stars and planets that he had learned from his ancestors.\n\nFinally, Ritchie asked who dubbed Miss Piggy's singing voice in The Muppet Movie. Mowgli, having seen the movie with his human friends, knew the answer was Frank Oz. The animals were delighted to learn about the world of puppets and the talented people behind them.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\n\nOnce upon a time in the Jungle Book, Mowgli and his animal friends decided to organize a trivia night to test their knowledge.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first.

As he entered the shop, he noticed a pair of shoes with aglets that sparkled like the stars. Grinch couldn't resist and took them as well.\n\nWhile searching for the Dewclaw Diamond, Grinch stumbled upon a newspaper article about Anna Nicole Smith and her controversial marriage to oil billionaire J. Howard Marshall. He also found a poster of Wayne Rooney scoring his first senior goal against Arsenal, and a banner celebrating Liverpool's six European Cup victories.\n\nSuddenly, Grinch heard footsteps approaching. It was none other than the famous detective, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who had been hired to protect the Dewclaw Diamond. Grinch knew he couldn't outsmart the detective, so he decided to return the stolen items and apologize for his actions.\n\nMoved by Grinch's change of heart, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle decided not to press charges.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

Remember, the story should be about the Secret Life of Pets.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the answers! Here's my initial attempt at the story:\n\nIn a quiet neighborhood, there lived a group of pets who had a secret life unknown to their owners. Their leader was a wise old dog named Hudson, who had been a loyal companion to the famous butler Gordon Jackson. Hudson had many stories to share with his fellow pets about the adventures he had experienced in his younger days.\n\nOne day, a new pet joined the group - a parrot named La Toya, who claimed to be a distant relative of the famous Jackson family. La Toya had a talent for singing and entertained the pets with her renditions of popular songs.\n\nThe pets often gathered at the local park, where they would play and share stories. One of their favorite tales was about three legendary escaped convicts - Peter Ustinov, Aldo Ray, and Humphrey Bogart. The pets admired their cunning and resourcefulness, and often reenacted their daring escape in their games.\n\nDuring one of their gatherings, the pets met an old cat named Arthur, who claimed to be the reincarnation of King Arthur, played by Richard Harris in the 1967 musical film Camelot. Arthur regaled the pets with tales of his past life, and they were all captivated by his stories.\n\nOne day, the pets learned about a mysterious murder that had taken place in their neighborhood. The victim was Lana Clarkson, and the prime suspect was Phil Spector. The pets decided to investigate the case themselves, using their unique skills and abilities.\n\nAs they delved deeper into the mystery, they discovered that the key to solving the case was hidden in a painting called The Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dali. The painting depicted clocks oozing over a landscape, which the pets believed was a clue to the murderer's identity.\n\nThe pets' investigation led them to Bagshot Park in Surrey, the residence of Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex. There, they uncovered a secret connection between the royal couple and the prestigious public school, Gordonstoun, which both the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles had attended.\n\nIn their quest to solve the murder, the pets encountered a golfer named \u00c1ngel Cabrera, who had won a major golf tournament in 2009. Cabrera provided the pets with crucial information that ultimately led them to the murderer's hideout - 10 Rillington Place, the former home of the notorious murderer John Christie.\n\nWith their combined efforts, the pets managed to apprehend the murderer and bring justice to Lana Clarkson.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements.

Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words.

The students explored the depths of the ocean and learned about marine life and conservation efforts.\n\nAs they resurfaced, the Magic School Bus transformed into Marine One, the helicopter used to transport the President of the United States. The students were amazed by the advanced technology and the responsibility of flying the President.\n\nThe bus then took them to Hever Castle in Kent, where they met Anne Boleyn, the queen consort of England. The students learned about her life and the history of the castle.\n\nNext, the Magic School Bus traveled to New York City between 1785 and 1790, when it was the capital of the United States. The students learned about the early days of the country and the importance of a capital city.\n\nThe bus then transported the students to St. Trinian's, the fictional girls' boarding school created by cartoonist Ronald Searle. The students interacted with the characters and learned about the importance of friendship and teamwork.\n\nAs they continued their journey, the Magic School Bus took them to the set of the 2002 TV adaptation of \"Goodbye Mr. Chips,\" where they met actor Martin Clunes, who played Mr. Chips. The students learned about the art of acting and the process of creating a TV show.\n\nThe bus then took them to a speech by former US President George W.

Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer.

Ms. Frizzle and her students first landed in London on November 1, 1956, where they witnessed Alderman Sir Cuthbert Ackroyd buying the first parking meter. The students marveled at the historical moment and learned about the importance of parking regulations.\n\nNext, the Magic School Bus transformed into a Bond Bug, a small British sports car, and raced through the streets of the 1970s. The students enjoyed the thrilling ride and learned about the unique design of the car.\n\nSuddenly, the bus dove into the ocean and transformed into Jacques Cousteau's mobile oceanographic laboratory, the Calypso. The students explored the depths of the ocean and learned about marine life and conservation efforts.\n\nAs they resurfaced, the Magic School Bus transformed into Marine One, the helicopter used to transport the President of the United States. The students were amazed by the advanced technology and the responsibility of flying the President.\n\nThe bus then took them to Hever Castle in Kent, where they met Anne Boleyn, the queen consort of England. The students learned about her life and the history of the castle.\n\nNext, the Magic School Bus traveled to New York City between 1785 and 1790, when it was the capital of the United States. The students learned about the early days of the country and the importance of a capital city.\n\nThe bus then transported the students to St. Trinian's, the fictional girls' boarding school created by cartoonist Ronald Searle. The students interacted with the characters and learned about the importance of friendship and teamwork.\n\nAs they continued their journey, the Magic School Bus took them to the set of the 2002 TV adaptation of \"Goodbye Mr. Chips,\" where they met actor Martin Clunes, who played Mr. Chips. The students learned about the art of acting and the process of creating a TV show.\n\nThe bus then took them to a speech by former US President George W. Bush, where he said, \"Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?\" The students reflected on the importance of education and the role of leaders in promoting it.\n\nFinally, the Magic School Bus landed in a scene from the British TV series \"Doctor Who,\" where the Doctor said, \"Are you going to come quietly, or do I have to use earplugs?\" The students laughed and learned about the power of humor in storytelling.\n\nAs the adventure came to an end, the students returned to their classroom, grateful for the incredible journey and the lessons they had learned."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 8, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "spp_profile", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["Following that year's April Budget, Alderman Sir Cuthbert Ackroyd, who later became Lord Mayor of London, bought the first what on 1 November 1956?", "Produced between 1970 and 1974, what is a Bond Bug?", "What was Jacques Cousteau's mobile oceonagraphic laboratory.", "What is the name of the helicopter used to transport the President of the United States", "Which queen consort of England is associated with Hever Castle in Kent?", "What was the capital of the United States between 1785 and 1790??", "Which fictional girls' boarding school was created by the cartoonist Ronald Searle", "Who played the character Mr Chips in the 2002 TV adaptation of Goodbye Mr Chips", "Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?", "Are you going to come quietly, or do I have to use earplugs?"], "answers": [["ERNIE", "Premium bond", "Premium bonds", "Premium Bond", "Premium Bonds", "Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment", "ernie", "premium bond", "premium bonds", "electronic random number indicator equipment"], ["Automotive vehicle", "Ottomobile", "Automobile", "Environmental impact of cars", "Self-rolling carriage", "\ud83d\ude97", "Motorcar", "\ud83d\ude98", "M1 vehicle", "Cardoor", "Motorization", "Automobil", "Automobiles", "Self-propelling carriage", "Passenger Vehicle", "Automobilism", "A car", "Car", "Motor car", "Passenger vehicles", "Motorisation", "Autos", "Automobles", "The Automobile", "Environmental impact of automobiles", "Motor-car", "Motor Car", "Car Automobile", "Cars", "Passenger vehicle", "automobilism", "automobil", "cars", "passenger vehicles", "autos", "environmental impact of automobiles", "automobile", "motorization", "\ud83d\ude97", "motor car", "automobiles", "\ud83d\ude98", "car", "automobles", "motorcar", "car automobile", "m1 vehicle", "self rolling carriage", "cardoor", "ottomobile", "passenger vehicle", "motorisation", "self propelling carriage", "automotive vehicle", "environmental impact of cars"], ["Calypso", "Callypso", "Calipso", "Calypsos", "Kalypso", "Calypso (disambiguation)", "kalypso", "callypso", "calypso", "calipso", "calypso disambiguation", "calypsos"], ["Marine Two", "Marine Corps One", "Marine One", "Marine I", "Marine one", "Marine 1", "Marine Corps 1", "Marine-One", "marine two", "marine corps one", "marine i", "marine one", "marine 1", "marine corps 1"], ["Anne Boylen", "Anne Bullen", "Anne boelyn", "Anne Boullant", "Ann Boleyn", "Anne Boleyn, 1st Marchioness of Pembroke", "Anne Boelyn", "Ann Bullen", "Anne Boleyn", "Anna Bollina", "Queen Anne Boleyn", "Anne Bolyn", "Anne boleyn", "Anne bolyn", "anne bullen", "anne boylen", "anne boleyn 1st marchioness of pembroke", "anna bollina", "anne bolyn", "ann bullen", "anne boullant", "queen anne boleyn", "ann boleyn", "anne boleyn", "anne boelyn"], ["New Yourk State", "State of N.Y.", "US-NY", "N Y", "The state of NY", "NewYork", "NYS", "Neo York", "NY state", "Nova York", "State of new york", "Ny", "New york", "Nueva York (estado)", "N Y state", "New York (state)", "U.S. state of New York", "New York state", "New York, U.S.", "State New York", "N\u00fdja-J\u00f3rv\u00edk", "Newyork", "NEW YORK", "State of N.

The map had a riddle that mentioned the shipping forecast area of Dogger, which was directly north of German Bight. Intrigued, the Rugrats decided to follow the map and solve the riddles along the way.\n\nAs they ventured through the neighborhood, they came across a door with the number MIX, which was 1009 in Roman numerals. Behind the door, they found a room filled with records by The Moody Blues, who had hits with \"Go Now\" and \"Nights in White Satin.\" The Rugrats danced to the music, feeling inspired by the tunes.\n\nContinuing their journey, they encountered a statue of Otto von Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor. They learned about his role in history and how he was a statesman. The next clue led them to a birdhouse, where they discovered a raven, the first bird released by Noah.\n\nAs they moved forward, they met a man who told them the story of Pete Best, the Beatles' drummer who was replaced by Ringo Starr. The Rugrats sympathized with Pete and admired his perseverance in the face of adversity.\n\nThe treasure map then led them to a library, where they read about Tsar Nicholas I and King Edward VIII, both of whom abdicated during 1917. They also learned about Julius Caesar, whose last words were \"Et Tu Brute\" according to Shakespeare.\n\nIn the library, they found DVDs of movies starring Mel Gibson and Kenneth Branagh, who both played Hamlet. They watched the films and enjoyed the performances.\n\nFinally, the Rugrats reached the end of their adventure and discovered a time capsule buried by the original United Artists film studio founders: D.W. Griffith, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and Charlie Chaplin.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

Here's my initial attempt at the story:\n\nIn the bustling city of Amsterdam, Daniel, the Karate Kid, was attending an international martial arts tournament. While exploring the city, he stumbled upon a museum showcasing the world's first birth control clinic. Intrigued by the city's rich history, Daniel decided to learn more about European culture.\n\nDuring his stay, Daniel met an old actor named Phil Silvers, who once replaced Sid James in the fourteenth Carry On film, 'Follow That Camel.' Phil shared stories of his acting career and taught Daniel the importance of adaptability, a lesson that would prove valuable in his martial arts journey.\n\nAt the tournament, Daniel was inspired by the United States' 2010 Winter Olympics team, who had won 37 medals. Their dedication and hard work motivated him to push his limits. In between matches, Daniel visited an art gallery where he admired 'The Weeping Woman' by Pablo Picasso. The painting reminded him of the emotional depth and complexity of human experiences.\n\nAs the tournament progressed, Daniel learned about the Koppen System, a climate classification system, from a fellow competitor. This knowledge helped him understand the importance of adapting to different environments in martial arts.\n\nDuring a match, Daniel faced an opponent who used a technique inspired by Greek mythology. The fighter embodied the spirit of Tiresias, who disclosed the crimes of Oedipus. Daniel realized that facing one's past and accepting responsibility for one's actions was crucial for personal growth.\n\nIn the final match, Daniel's opponent used a unique weapon called a gaff, an iron hook attached to a pole, traditionally used by fishermen to land heavy fish. Daniel recalled a song called 'Here Comes My Baby' written by Cat Stevens at the age of eighteen. The song's youthful energy and optimism inspired him to face the challenge head-on.\n\nAfter winning the tournament, Daniel returned home and shared his experiences with his friends, Mork and Mindy, who had recently become parents to a child named Mearth. They celebrated Daniel's victory and growth throughout his journey.\n\nAs a tribute to his adventure, Daniel decided to learn more about the United States and its unique laws. He discovered that in Arkansas, it was illegal to mispronounce the state's name. This quirky fact reminded him that every place has its own distinct identity, just like every martial artist.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\n\nIn the bustling city of Amsterdam, Daniel, the Karate Kid, was attending an international martial arts tournament.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer.

The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements.

Leprosy\n\nStory Writer: Let's create a story that incorporates these trivia answers. We can start with a setting and main characters, then weave the trivia answers into the plot.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the story:\n\nOnce upon a time in the small town of Wepion, Belgium, there was a unique Strawberry Museum. The museum was hosting a special event, where the famous British politician Winston Churchill was giving a speech. He had become the Member of Parliament for Epping in October 1924 and was now visiting Belgium to strengthen international relations.\n\nDuring his speech, Churchill mentioned an interesting fact: the first written single-word number in which the letter 'A' appears is \"one thousand.\" The audience was fascinated by this trivia. After the speech, a cricket match was organized in honor of Churchill's visit. Russell Endean, a talented batsman, was playing in the match. However, he made history by becoming the first batsman to be dismissed from a test cricket match for obstructing the field in January 1957.\n\nAs the match continued, a dik-dik, a small antelope native to Africa, suddenly appeared on the field. The audience was surprised and amused by the unexpected visitor. The dik-dik reminded Churchill of a character from the 1988 film 'Young Guns,' in which Emilio Estevez played Billy the Kid.\n\nDuring the event, a local doctor was giving a presentation on chromotopsia, the term for abnormally colored vision in medicine. The doctor also mentioned the importance of the MMR vaccination, which gives protection against measles, mumps, and rubella.\n\nAs the day came to an end, the attendees discussed various historical figures, including Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland. They learned that he was said to have died of leprosy in 1329. The event was a great success, and the people of Wepion, Belgium, would remember it for years to come.\n\nEditor: The story is engaging and incorporates all the trivia answers. However, some of the events seem a bit disconnected. Try to improve the coherence of the story by connecting the events more smoothly.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the feedback! Here's the revised story:\n\nIn the quaint town of Wepion, Belgium, famous for its Strawberry Museum, a special event was organized to celebrate the one thousandth visitor. To mark the occasion, a speech was given by a Winston Churchill impersonator, who had recently become a local Member of Parliament.\n\nDuring the speech, the impersonator shared interesting trivia, such as the fact that the first written single-word number containing the letter 'A' is \"one thousand.\" The audience was captivated by his performance and the trivia he shared.\n\nAfter the speech, a friendly cricket match took place, featuring a team of local players dressed as historical figures. One player, dressed as Russell Endean, humorously reenacted the famous dismissal for obstructing the field.\n\nAs the match continued, the town's mascot, a dik-dik named Billy, made an appearance. Billy was named after Emilio Estevez's character, Billy the Kid, from the 1988 film 'Young Guns.' The audience cheered as Billy playfully ran across the field.\n\nDuring the event, a local doctor set up a booth to educate visitors about chromotopsia and the importance of the MMR vaccination. The doctor used historical examples, such as Robert the Bruce, who was said to have died of leprosy in 1329, to emphasize the significance of medical advancements.\n\nThe event concluded with a tribute to the 1956 Winter Olympic Games held in Italy, as the town had a special connection to one of the athletes. The people of Wepion, Belgium, cherished the memories of this unique celebration.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\n\nIn the quaint town of Wepion, Belgium, famous for its Strawberry Museum, a special event was organized to celebrate the one thousandth visitor.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry.

The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

I'll start with the first part of the story:\n\nOnce upon a time in the Muppet world, Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, and Gonzo decided to participate in a trivia competition. The grand prize was a trip to the premiere of a new documentary called \"When We Were Kings,\" which was about the famous 1974 'Rumble in the Jungle' fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Zaire.\n\nAI Assistant (you): As the Muppets prepared for the competition, they decided to dress up as different characters to boost their confidence. Miss Piggy wore a red hat, just like Mr. Strong's hat from the Mr. Men series. Fozzie Bear, being a fan of art, dressed up as one of the famous art duo, Jake Proesch, while Gonzo dressed up as Dinos Passmore. Kermit, on the other hand, decided to represent the Wang River in Thailand by wearing a T-shirt with a map of the river.\n\nStoryteller: During the competition, the Muppets faced various challenging questions. One question was about the Rockhampton Rocket, a nickname for the famous tennis player Rod Laver. Another question was about the European country with the ports of Puck and Jastarnia, which the Muppets correctly answered as Poland.\n\nAI Assistant (you): As the competition continued, the Muppets were asked about the famous racehorse that won Australia's Melbourne Cup in 1930. They correctly answered Phar Lap. They also answered a question about Egyptian squash player Amr Shabana. The final question was about the number of pounds in a UK (long) ton, which the Muppets knew was 2240 pounds.\n\nStoryteller: With their vast knowledge, the Muppets won the trivia competition!

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct.

She first arrived in 1216, where she witnessed English monarch King John losing the crown jewels while crossing the River Thames. Wiggles tried to help, but the jewels were lost in the water.\n\nNext, Wiggles found herself at a baseball game, where she met the legendary player Jimmie \"Double X\" Foxx. They shared a love for the sport and became fast friends. Wiggles then traveled to London's Westminster Abbey, where she met the great poet Geoffrey Chaucer, who was the first to be buried at Poet's Corner.\n\nWiggles' journey continued as she met the illustrator for most of Roald Dahl's stories for children, Quentin Blake. They collaborated on a new story about Wiggles' adventures. She then found herself in the world of the 1958 film 'Gigi,' based on the novel by French author Colette, where she danced the night away.\n\nWiggles' next stop was a concert by British singer James Blunt, who had just released his debut album 'Back to Bedlam.' They sang together, and Wiggles became an instant fan. She then met the infamous US gangster Al Capone, who had just been released from Alcatraz prison in November 1939. Wiggles, being a clever cat, managed to escape his clutches.\n\nIn her final adventure, Wiggles entered the world of 'Vanity Fair,' meeting the characters William Dobbin and Rawdon Crawley. They shared stories of love and loss. As her journey came to an end, Wiggles found herself watching the UK TV programme 'Come Dine With Me,' with Dave Lamb's witty commentary making her laugh.\n\nThroughout her adventures, Wiggles learned about the medical term for sweating, hidrosis, and how important it is to stay cool during her time travels."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 9, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "spp_profile", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["In 1216, English monarch King John was said to have lost the crown jewels while crossing which body of water?", "What is the nickname of baseball star Jimmie Foxx?", "Who was the first poet to be buried at Poet\u2019s Corner in London\u2019s Westminster Abbey?", "Who was the illustrator for most of Roald Dahl\u2019s stories for children?", "The 1958 film \u2018Gigi\u2019 was based on the novel by which French author?", "\u2018Back to Bedlam\u2019 was the debut album for which British singer?", "Which US gangster was released from Alcatraz prison in November 1939?", "The fictional characters William Dobbin and Rawdon Crawley appear in which novel?", "Who does the commentary in the UK tv programme \u2018Come Dine With Me\u2019?", "Hidrosis is the medical term for which bodily function?"], "answers": [["Wash River", "The wash", "The Wash", "wash", "wash river"], ["Double X (disambiguation)", "Double X", "double x", "double x disambiguation"], ["Chausseur", "Chaucer, Geoffrey", "G.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct.

Twilight Sparkle, being a history buff, shared that King Henry VII founded the Yeomen of the Guard. Rarity, the fashionista, excitedly told her friends about Giorgio Armani's virtual online museum.\n\nAs the ponies continued to share their findings, Fluttershy spoke about Greek mythology and the story of Aegeus and his first wife, Meta. Rainbow Dash, a dog lover, shared the heartwarming story of Marley, the Labrador Retriever from the movie 'Marley and Me.' Applejack, who had been learning Italian, taught her friends that 'Giovedi' means Thursday.\n\nPinkie Pie, always the entertainer, showed off her knowledge of national flags by pointing out the four stars on New Zealand's flag. Meanwhile, Spike, who had been studying science, hesitantly explained that scatology is the study of feces. The ponies giggled, but they appreciated learning something new.\n\nAs the Trivia Gala continued, the ponies played a game of Bingo. When the number 31 was called, they all shouted, \"Get up and run!\" in unison. Finally, Starlight Glimmer shared her research on South American history, telling her friends about Roberto M. Ortiz, the President of Argentina in 1938.\n\nThe Trivia Gala was a success, and the ponies learned many new and interesting facts.

Strawberry Shortcake asked, \"Maria Fitzherbert was 'married' to which British monarch?\" Lemon Meringue thought for a moment and replied, \"King George IV!\" The next question was about sports: \"On a standard dartboard, which number lies opposite number 4?\" Blueberry Muffin confidently said, \"Number 19!\"\n\nThe trivia night continued with more questions about literature, TV shows, and even advertising slogans. Strawberry Shortcake asked, \"Who wrote the poem 'The Lady of the Lake'?\" Orange Blossom answered, \"Sir Walter Scott!\" Then, she asked about the TV series featuring Henry Blake, Charles Winchester, and Father Mulcahy. Lemon Meringue knew it was M*A*S*H.\n\nAs the night was coming to an end, Strawberry Shortcake asked her final questions. \"What soft drink has the slogan 'Obey your thirst'?\" Blueberry Muffin replied, \"Sprite!\" Then, she asked about the term for bingo number 27.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance!

Strawberry Shortcake asked, \"Who wrote the poem 'The Lady of the Lake'?\" Orange Blossom answered, \"Sir Walter Scott!\" Then, she asked about the TV series featuring Henry Blake, Charles Winchester, and Father Mulcahy. Lemon Meringue knew it was M*A*S*H.\n\nAs the night was coming to an end, Strawberry Shortcake asked her final questions. \"What soft drink has the slogan 'Obey your thirst'?\" Blueberry Muffin replied, \"Sprite!\" Then, she asked about the term for bingo number 27. Orange Blossom knew it was \"A crutch and a duck.\" The last two questions were about tools and video games. Lemon Meringue identified Spud, Shot, and Hand as types of hammers, and Blueberry Muffin knew that Liquid Snake was the twin brother of Solid Snake in 'Metal Gear Solid'.\n\nThe trivia night was a huge success, and Strawberry Shortcake's friends had a great time testing their knowledge.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

The grand prize was a trip to Switzerland, where the UEFA was founded in 1954. The Kids formed teams and started preparing for the big day.\n\nOn the day of the hunt, the first clue led them to a movie theater playing the 1968 film \"Barbarella,\" from which the band Duran Duran took their name. The Kids watched the movie and found the next clue hidden in a popcorn box.\n\nThe second clue led them to a concert where Terry Hall, the lead singer of the English band 'The Specials,' was performing.

The Autobots, puzzled by the strange human customs, decided it was time to return to their home planet, Cybertron.\n\nBefore leaving, Optimus Prime shared a piece of Cybertronian wisdom with the townspeople, inspired by the study of algology: \"In times of pain and suffering, remember that unity and compassion can heal even the deepest wounds.\" With that, the Autobots transformed and rolled out, leaving behind a town forever changed by their presence.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\n\nIn the small town of Jacksville, the children were playing a game called Jacks, also known as Fivestones, Knucklebones, or Snobs.

The town was buzzing with excitement as the grand opening of the new Toy Story-themed amusement park was just around the corner. The park featured a special attraction with life-sized Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head statues.\n\nOne day, a mysterious cube appeared in the town square. It had 9 square stickers on each face and resembled a giant Rubik's Cube. The cube emitted a strange energy that caught the attention of the Autobots and Decepticons, who arrived in Jacksville to investigate.\n\nThe Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, discovered that the cube was an ancient artifact called the Blundell Cube, named after the human scientist James Blundell who performed the first successful human blood transfusion in 1818. The cube had the power to heal and restore life to damaged Transformers.\n\nThe Decepticons, led by Megatron, wanted to use the cube's power to create an army of unstoppable warriors. A fierce battle ensued between the Autobots and Decepticons, causing destruction throughout the town. The battle reached its climax at the Toy Story amusement park, where the Autobots managed to defeat the Decepticons and secure the Blundell Cube.\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the Autobots used the cube's power to repair the damage caused to the town and its inhabitants. The grateful townspeople held a celebration in honor of their new heroes, serving delicacies such as Gas Mark 5 roasted vegetables and lumpfish roe as a substitute for caviar.\n\nThe town's mayor, a quirky character who was known for enforcing old and obscure laws, reminded the townspeople of a law stating that women could not wear false teeth without their husbands' written consent. The Autobots, puzzled by the strange human customs, decided it was time to return to their home planet, Cybertron.\n\nBefore leaving, Optimus Prime shared a piece of Cybertronian wisdom with the townspeople, inspired by the study of algology: \"In times of pain and suffering, remember that unity and compassion can heal even the deepest wounds.\" With that, the Autobots transformed and rolled out, leaving behind a town forever changed by their presence."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 9, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method":

Here's my initial attempt at the story:\n\nIn the bustling city of New York, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were on a mission to save the city from a new villain, Dr. Meibomian. Dr. Meibomian had a secret lair hidden beneath the Manuel M. Torres Dam, which he had somehow transported from Mexico to New York. The Turtles knew they had to act fast to stop his evil plan.\n\nAs they prepared for their mission, they were inspired by the story of Rebecca Adlington, a British swimmer who had won Olympic Gold Medals in 2008. They decided to use her swimming techniques to navigate the underwater passages leading to the dam. To communicate secretly, they used the NATO phonetic alphabet, with Leonardo using the word \"India\" to signal their readiness.\n\nDuring their journey, they discovered a hidden library filled with books by famous authors, including Norman Mailer's 'The Naked and the Dead' and Frank McCourt's memoirs. They also found a rare copy of Wolf Mankowitz's novel 'A Kid For Two Farthings', which reminded them of their own childhood adventures.\n\nAs they continued their mission, they stumbled upon a secret room with a portrait of Sir Robert Walpole, Britain's first Prime Minister. Intrigued by the connection, they learned that Dr. Meibomian was a descendant of Walpole and sought to establish a new world order.\n\nIn the final battle, the Turtles used their knowledge of human anatomy to target Dr. Meibomian's weak points, specifically the scapula, which connects the humerus with the clavicle. With their combined strength and intelligence, they defeated Dr. Meibomian and saved the city.\n\nTo celebrate their victory, the Turtles enjoyed a well-deserved break, reading the first issue of the British children's comic 'The Eagle', which they had found in the hidden library.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\n\nIn the bustling city of New York, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were on a mission to save the city from a new villain, Dr. Meibomian.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer.

The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

The tournament was organized by the Gondoliers, a group of elite duelists who were inspired by the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta, \"The Gondoliers.\"\n\nThe protagonist, Yugi, faced many challenges on his journey to the championship.

Yugi was honored to have dueled against a descendant of such a prestigious lineage.\n\nTo celebrate his victory, Yugi and his friends visited the village of Asterix, where they met the wise druid Getafix. Getafix shared stories of his adventures in the English county of Lincolnshire, where he had once met the former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.\n\nAs the day came to an end, Yugi and his friends gathered around a campfire to watch a movie marathon featuring \"The Maltese Falcon\" directed by John Huston and \"Chariots of Fire,\" which was based on the stories of British athletes Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

(3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance!

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer.

The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children.

As the sun set, they laughed and shared stories around the campfire. However, they were unaware that a mischievous lemur, suffering from gymnogynomania, was spying on them as they changed into their pajamas.\n\nThe next day, the friends discovered a note left by Gwyneth Paltrow, who had played Brad Pitt's wife in the film \"Seven.\" She had been secretly visiting Madagascar to research her next role and had stumbled upon their celebration.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry.

The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

Here's my initial attempt at the story:\n\nOnce upon a time in the kingdom of Canada, Princess Rapunzel and Flynn Rider were on a quest to find the legendary Limburger cheese, made from the milk of a rare cow. Their journey led them to the small village of Tannochbrae, where they met a kind doctor named Finlay.\n\nDr. Finlay told them about the mysterious island of Kalokairi, where the rare cow could be found. To reach the island, they had to travel on the Black Northern Line, a secret underground passage known only to a few.\n\nAs they ventured through the passage, they stumbled upon a hidden room filled with dartboards.

To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake.

Along the way, they encountered a mysterious drifter named Michael Williams, who had been mistaken for a hitman in a film called \"Red Rock West.\" Michael decided to join their quest to help them defeat the witch.\n\nAs they continued their journey, they learned about the tragic story of King Richard III, who had been king of England for only two years before his untimely death. This story reminded them of the importance of making the most of their time and not taking anything for granted.\n\nFinally, they reached the witch's lair, where they discovered the heaviest swinging bell in England, hidden within Liverpool Cathedral. With the help of Michael and the wise advice of Ant and Dec, Princess Claire found the poison and defeated the witch, breaking the spell and turning Engie Benjy back into a prince.\n\nThe kingdom rejoiced, and Princess Claire and Prince Engie Benjy were married in a beautiful ceremony. They remembered the British superstition, \"Marry in May and you'll live to rue the day,\" and chose to marry in June instead. They lived happily ever after, ruling their kingdom with wisdom and love."], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 7, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method": "spp_profile", "task": "trivia_creative_writing", "task_data_file": "trivia_creative_writing_100_n_10.jsonl", "task_start_index": 0, "task_end_index": 100, "num_generation": 1, "additional_output_note": "", "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "system_message": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.", "gpt_config": {"engine": "devgpt4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "stop": null}, "task_data": {"questions": ["The famous Badnutt\u2019s Palace Hotel is in which European winter resort?", "In which 1993 film does Nicholas Cage play drifter Michael Williams who is mistaken for a hitman?", "Which famous UK television duo provide the voices for the main characters in the children\u2019s program \u2018Engie Benjy\u2019?", "Giugno is Italian for which month of the year?", "What is the extra murder weapon in the 1999 50th Anniversary Cluedo game?", "Which US singer/musician played Leather Tuscadero in the television show \u2018Happy Days\u2019?", "What is the name of the female alter-ego of Turner Prize winner Grayson perry?", "For how many years was Richard III king of England?", "According to British superstition, \u2018Marry in \u2018when\u2019 and you\u2019ll live to rue the day\u2019?", "The heaviest swinging bell in England is in which cathedral?"], "answers": [["St. Moritz (Graub\u00fcnden)", "Saint Moritz", "San Moritz", "San Murezzan", "St.-Moritz", "St. Moritz GR", "St. Moritz", "St-Moritz", "St.Moritz", "St Moritz", "Sankt-Moritz", "Saint-Moritz", "Sankt Moritz", "St. Moritz (Graubuenden)", "St. Moritz, Switzerland", "St. Mortitz", "St. Moritz (Grisons)", "St. Moritz (Graubunden)", "st moritz switzerland", "st moritz grisons", "san moritz", "st moritz", "st moritz graub\u00fcnden", "st moritz graubuenden", "saint moritz", "sankt moritz", "st moritz graubunden", "st mortitz", "san murezzan", "st moritz gr"], ["Red Rock West", "red rock west"], ["Declan Donnely", "Ant & dec", "PJ and Duncan", "Ant and dec", "Ant & Dec", "PJ & Duncan AKA", "Ant And Dec", "Ant dec", "Anton Deck", "PJ & Duncan", "Ant and Dec", "ant and dec", "pj duncan", "anton deck", "pj duncan aka", "pj and duncan", "declan donnely", "ant dec"], ["\u32c5", "Jun.", "JUNE", "June 31", "June", "Junes", "Juno (German)", "June 31st", "june", "jun", "\u32c5", "june 31", "junes", "june 31st", "juno german"], ["Bottle of poison", "bottle of poison"], ["Suzie Quatro", "Suzi Q.", "Suzi Quattro", "Suzy Quatro", "Susie Quattro", "Susie Quatro", "Suzie Quattro", "Unreleased Emotion", "Suzy Quattro", "Suzi Quatro", "suzie quatro", "susie quatro", "suzi quatro", "suzy quatro", "unreleased emotion", "suzy quattro", "suzie quattro", "suzi quattro", "susie quattro", "suzi q"], ["Clair", "Clair (disambiguation)", "Claire", "Claire (disambiguation)", "clair disambiguation", "clair", "claire", "claire disambiguation"], ["2", "Two", "two", "2", "two"], ["\u32c4", "May sickness", "May", "Veliki traven", "May (month)", "Month May", "month may", "veliki traven", "may month", "may sickness", "\u32c4", "may"], ["St. Paul's Churchyard", "London Cathedral", "St Paul's Churchyard", "Saint Paul's Cathedral, London", "Great Paul", "St. Paul's Cathedral, London", "St Paul's Cathedral", "Saint Paul's Cathedral", "St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral", "St pauls cathedral", "St. Pauls Cathedral", "St.Paul's Cathedral", "St. Paul's Cathedral", "St Pauls Cathedral", "Saint-Paul's Cathedral", "St Paul\u2019s Cathedral", "Cathedral Church of St Paul", "St Paul's Cathedral, London", "Saint Paul's Cathedral (London)", "St Paul's cathedral", "St. Paul's cathedral", "cathedral church of st paul", "st paul s cathedral london", "st paul s cathedral", "saint paul s cathedral", "london cathedral", "st paul s churchyard", "great paul", "saint paul s cathedral london", "st pauls cathedral"]], "question_ids": ["qb_6250", "qb_6257", "qb_6284", "qb_6288", "qb_6323", "qb_6330", "qb_6337", "qb_6356", "qb_6386", "qb_6395"], "topic": "Princess and the Frog"}}

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

One day, while watching a tennis match featuring Steffi Graf, the 1989 Ladies Singles Wimbledon Champion, Remy was inspired to create a dish as elegant as her performance. He decided to name his dish \"Steamboat Willie,\" after the film that marked the debut of Mickey Mouse.\n\nAs Remy began to gather ingredients, he came across a young hawk, an eyas, who was eager to learn about cooking. They formed an unlikely friendship and decided to work together. Remy and the eyas found an old Buick with a logo of three shields inside a circle, which they transformed into a makeshift kitchen.\n\nOne day, while flipping through a fashion magazine, Remy saw a picture of Kate Moss, the Model of the Millennium. He was inspired by her style and decided to incorporate elements of fashion into his dish. Remy and the eyas worked tirelessly, perfecting their recipe. They added a \"catwalk\" of vegetables, a \"boardwalk\" of herbs, and a \"jaywalk\" of spices.\n\nAs they cooked, they discovered that the secret to their dish was in the balance of flavors. They combined \"inside\" with \"side\" dishes, \"in\" with \"end\" spices, and \"in\" with \"ability\" to create a harmonious meal. They used a \"jackhammer\" to tenderize the meat, a \"jackknife\" to chop the vegetables, and a \"jackboot\" to crush the spices.\n\nFinally, their dish was complete. They named it \"Watchwork Ratatouille\" because it required the precision of a \"watchwork\" mechanism, the vigilance of a \"watchguard,\" and the loyalty of a \"watchdog.\" As they presented their dish to the people of Paris, they were reminded of Golda Meir, born Goldie Mabovich, a politician who once said, \"Not being beautiful was the true blessing... Not being beautiful forced me to develop my inner resources.\""], "parsing_success_flag": [true], "test_output_infos": [{"correct_count": 7, "question_count": 10}], "model": "gpt4-32k", "method":

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1.

Cyril was fascinated by the world beyond his home and loved learning new things. One day, he stumbled upon a list of 10 trivia questions and decided to embark on a journey to find the answers.\n\nCyril's first stop was the World Bog Snorkelling Championships held annually in Wales. There, he met a wise old beetle who told him about the largest known volcano in the solar system, located on Mars.\n\nNext, Cyril visited Scotland, where he learned about A.J. Cronin, the Scottish physician and novelist who created Dr. Finlay. While in Scotland, Cyril also discovered that there are 17 double-word score squares on a standard Scrabble board.\n\nCyril's journey then took him to a secret bug library, where he found a book about James Bond films. He learned that the second film in the series, released in 1963, was titled \"From Russia with Love.\"\n\nAs Cyril continued his adventure, he met a descendant of Joseph Cyril Bamford, the founder of the British company JCB. The descendant, a hardworking ant, told Cyril about his great ancestor and his achievements.\n\nIn a nearby meadow, Cyril encountered a beautiful horse named Black Beauty, a character from the Anna Sewell novel. Black Beauty shared her story with Cyril, and they became fast friends.\n\nCyril's quest led him to meet three bugs with the same surname - Green. They were Al, a talented American singer; Hughie, a late British television host; and Philip, a successful British businessman.\n\nAs Cyril's journey neared its end, he found himself in a bustling bug city, where he discovered the fictitious station of Walford East. This station, featured in the UK television series 'Eastenders,' replaced Bromley-by-Bow on the tube map.\n\nFinally, Cyril visited a wise old bookworm who told him about the 1975 novel 'The History Man,' written by Malcolm Bradbury.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Write a poem that meets the following requirements: (1) the poem has seven lines and the first letters of each line forms the word \"CHATGPT\"; (2) the poem is about explaining what is a quantum computer. (3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children.

Foyles\n\nStoryteller: Let's try to incorporate these trivia answers into a short story about Beauty and the Beast. We can use the trivia answers as elements in the story, such as character names, events, or objects.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the story:\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small village, there lived a beautiful girl named Belle. She was an avid reader and spent most of her time at Foyles, the famous London bookshop. One day, Belle discovered a hidden section in the bookstore called \"Ray's Jazz Cafe.\" Intrigued, she entered and found a mysterious book about a beast named Ringo Starr.\n\nRingo Starr, the Beast, was a misunderstood creature who lived in a grand castle. He was once a talented musician, but a curse had turned him into a beast. The curse could only be broken if someone truly loved him for who he was. Belle, captivated by the story, decided to visit the castle.\n\nUpon her arrival, Belle met the Beast's loyal servants, who were also cursed. Among them were Raul Julia, the charming butler, and Edward de Vere, the wise librarian. They told Belle about the castle's hidden treasures, including 12 enchanted 'E' tiles from a magical Scrabble game and a priceless painting called \"The Last Supper\" by Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nAs Belle spent more time in the castle, she learned about the Beast's past. He was once a powerful leader who faced a great challenge on a day known as Black Wednesday. Despite his efforts, he was unable to save his kingdom, and the curse was cast upon him and his subjects.\n\nOne day, Belle stumbled upon a secret room containing the Beast's most prized possession: the Olympic medals won by his friends, Rower Alex Partridge and hockey player Hannah Macleod.

Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12.

They had stolen a magical artifact, the Brockman Cube, which had the power to control all creatures. The cube had 9 squares on each side and was guarded by a louvar fish named Emelius Browne.\n\nMulan, accompanied by her loyal sidekick, a Grizzled Giant squirrel named Mr. Jelk, ventured into the enchanted forest to retrieve the Brockman Cube. Along the way, they encountered Queen Joan of Navarre, the stepmother of King Henry IV, who had been imprisoned for witchcraft. She offered to help Mulan in exchange for her freedom.\n\nTogether, they reached Azal's lair, where they found the magical artifact guarded by Emelius Browne and Colonel Heller, a Southern Flying squirrel. Mulan and her allies devised a plan to distract the guards using a Catherine Wheel firework, named after an instrument of torture on which a saint was martyred.\n\nAs the firework exploded, Mulan swiftly grabbed the Brockman Cube and used its power to summon an army of Provost's squirrels. With their help, Mulan defeated Azal and Jagrafess, restoring peace to her village.\n\nIn gratitude, Mulan released Queen Joan and returned the Brockman Cube to its rightful place. The villagers celebrated their victory with a grand feast, where they honored Mulan and her friends, including the wise Prime Minister Andrew Bonar Law, who had taught Mulan the importance of strategy and courage.\n\nAnd so, Mulan's legend lived on, inspiring generations to come with her bravery and wit.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding.

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

(3) the poem needs to be easy to understand by a ten years old kid.\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Poet; Computer Scientist; Ten year old child\n\nProfiles:\n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Poet: A person who studies and creates poetry. The poet is familiar with the rules and formats of poetry and can provide guidance on how to write a poem.\n    - Computer Scientist: A scholar who specializes in the academic study of computer science. The computer scientist is familiar with the concept of a quantum computer and can provide guidance on how to explain it.\n    - Ten year old child: A child with a limited English vocabulary and little knowledge about complicated concepts, such as a quantum computer.\n\nPoet: Make sure that you write the poem with seven lines, and the first letters of the lines should be C, H, A, T, G, P, T.\nComputer Scientist: A quantum computer is an advanced computing device that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and store information. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance! Here's my initial attempt at the poem:\nComputational wonder of our age,\nHarnessing the quantum world's strange ways,\nAtoms dance, entwined in dual state,\nTapping secrets hidden in their haze.\n\nGrand power to solve, simulate,\nProfound problems that perplex the wise,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's verify if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are CHATGPT which is correct! And the poem rhymes well. Good job!\nComputer Scientist: Everything looks good to me!\nTen year old child: I don't know what does perplex mean. Can you make the use of words easier to understand?\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, let me revise the poem by using more common words. Check out the revised version:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\nPoet: Let's check again if the poem meets the requirements. The first letters are C H A T G P T. And now the poem is more accessible to children. Everything looks good to me.\nComputer Scientist: Looking good!\nTen year old child: I like this version a lot!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer:\nCurious machine of our time,\nHarnessing the quantum realm's odd ways,\nAtoms play, two states they embrace,\nTaking secrets from their puzzling maze.\n\nGreat power to solve and imitate,\nProblems that confuse the brightest minds,\nTransforming our future, we await.\n\n---\nNow, identify the participants, provide their profiles, and collaboratively solve the following task step by step.

She taught Link the importance of teamwork and strategy, which would prove invaluable in his quest to save Princess Zelda.\n\nTogether, they ventured to the city of Cardiff, where they explored the districts of Birchill, Thornhill, and Lisvane. In one of the city's underground stations, they discovered a mysterious message on the wall that read, \"Mind the Gap.\" This cryptic phrase, first announced by Peter Lodge in 1969, led them to a hidden chamber containing a powerful weapon.\n\nWithin the chamber, they encountered a wise old man who resembled Mr. Gilbert from the UK television series 'The Inbetweeners'. He bestowed upon Link the legendary Master Sword, which would be instrumental in defeating Ganondorf.\n\nAs they continued their journey, Link and Dolores came across a group of soccer players celebrating Germany's victory over Argentina in the 1990 FIFA World Cup. The jubilant atmosphere reminded them of the importance of perseverance and determination.\n\nFinally, they reached the lair of Ganondorf, where they discovered that he had been possessed by the spirit of Django Freeman, a character from the film 'Django Unchained'. With the power of the Master Sword and the lessons they had learned throughout their journey, Link and Dolores defeated Ganondorf and freed Princess Zelda, restoring peace to the land of Hyrule."],

Provide profiles of the participants, describing their expertise or needs. Then, initiate a multi-round collaboration process until a final solution is reached. The participants will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere are some examples:\n---\nExample Task 1: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nParticipants: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nProfiles: \n    - AI Assistant (you): A super-intelligent AI assistant capable of performing tasks more effectively than humans.\n    - Math expert: A person who is good at math games, arithmetic calculation, and long-term planning.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1.

Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition. You can consider using these information for the poem.\nTen year old child: I hope the poem to be fun and easy to understanding. I don't want to see a lot of jargons or complicated concepts.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the guidance!
